# Docker Server Full Setup 2.1 (reconciled 2026-08-18; paradigm notes 2026-08-27)

This guide builds an acquisition server — **dev, staging, or (future) prod** — from
scratch. The **staging server (acq-vm-0) is the reference copy**: every command,
image tag, branch, permission, and schedule below was verified against that live
server on 2026-08-18, at the end of the August hardening plan
(`PLAN_OF_ATTACK_2026-08.md`; finding IDs like SEC-05 or DB-01 refer to
`AUDIT_RECONCILIATION_FINDINGS_2026-08-14.md`). When this document and a server
disagree, one of them is wrong — fix the drift, then fix the document.

> **PARADIGM MIGRATION COMPLETE for the app fleet (2026-08-24 → 2026-08-26).**

**Read this first — per-server identity.** The document is one recipe for all three
server types. Wherever a command says `<DB_NAME>` (or another `<...>` placeholder),
substitute this server's value; wherever a concrete value appears, the text says
which server it belongs to. The identity table:

| | dev server | staging (acq-vm-0) | prod (future) |
|---|---|---|---|
| App database `<DB_NAME>` | `dev` | `staging` | `prod` |
| App-repo branch | `DEV_docker` | `STAGING_docker` | `PROD_docker` (doesn't exist yet) |
| Admin-repo branch (redis-admin, pg_manage_v2) | `DEV` | `STAGING` | TBD |
| `RUN_ENV` (**RETIRED fleet-wide** with the last app migration, 2026-08-26 — logger routing is the `LOG_DIR` mount now) | — | — | — |
| `IMAGE_TAG` (**hhm_rpp shared image only** — its three consumers keep the variable as the shared-tag knob: dev = username in ge's clone, `svc` in every release. Every other app tags by `USER_ID`) | username | `svc` in releases | TBD |
| `PG_DB` for maintenance scripts | `dev` | `staging` (default) | `prod` |

Every other value in this doc (uids, gids, IPs, secrets) is **per-host** and lives
only in untracked `.env` files — see CONVENTIONS.

**What changed since 2.0** (2026-07-27): database container under version control
(tracked compose, no password in metadata); Redis ports removed from the host and
**auth enabled**; nightly backups + pruning + partition watchdog actually installed;
`RUN_ENV=staging` fleet-wide with central run logs; the fail-loudly outcome contract
(`run_outcome/v1`) on all six job apps; every image now built by Compose; allowlist
`.dockerignore`s; container log caps; maintenance scripts moved into their owning
repos; `saved_files` 48-hour retention restored; odd-jobs documented as the partition
maintenance owner.

**Scope:** dev and staging servers. **No PROD server exists yet** — `PROD_docker`
branches, a prod cutover runbook, and prod data-governance decisions are future work,
deliberately out of scope (Phase 4j).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONVENTIONS — the server as it really is

There is no single `ENV` knob. A server's identity is set by four independent axes —
set each one explicitly and don't assume they match:

| Axis | Value on acq-vm-0 | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| Git branch (per repo, table below) | `STAGING_docker` / `STAGING` / `main` | which code runs |
| Image tags | **identity tags fleet-wide**: `<app>:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`, e.g. `data-acqu:svc` in production). Exception: the shared `hhm_rpp:${IMAGE_TAG}` image (same dev/svc values, one tag for three consumers) | which image compose runs |
| Compose volume vars | `_DEV`-suffixed names (`DATA_STORE_DEV`) — `NODE_MOD_CACHE_DEV` is **retired fleet-wide** (in-tree per-copy deps) | where caches/files live — the *names* are fixed in compose; point their *values* wherever this server stores data |
| `LOG_DIR` in `.env` | `${LOG_DIR:-<dev path>}` compose mount — dev path by default (fails safe), `/opt/run-logs/<app>` via `#RELEASE:LOG_DIR` in releases. (`RUN_ENV`, its predecessor, is retired fleet-wide) | **logger file routing only** — not deployment |

Database: the single local Postgres serves **one app database, `<DB_NAME>`** (from
the identity table: `dev`/`staging`/`prod`), for every app (`PGDATABASE=<DB_NAME>`).
Create exactly one — a second database that "matches the other server's name" is how
apps end up pointed at an empty DB (the pre-August monday failure).

**Host identity lives only in untracked `.env` files** (convention since 2026-08-06):
numeric uid/gid values (`UID_0/1/2`, `DOCKER_GID`, `SVC_UID`), image tags
(`IMAGE_TAG`), and secrets never appear in tracked files. Committed `.env.example`
files carry **placeholders, not staging's real numbers** — a real value in an example
would silently poison a new server whose ids differ (REL-07). Builds fail loudly when
the variables are unset; that is deliberate. The same fail-loud rule applies to file
bind-mounts: long-form syntax with `create_host_path: false` everywhere a missing
host file must stop the build instead of being auto-created as an empty directory.

**Branch map (clone target per repo; upstreams are set — `git pull` works
everywhere).** The env-branch repos follow the identity table: `DEV_docker`/`DEV` on
a dev server, `STAGING_docker`/`STAGING` on staging (shown), `PROD_docker` when prod
exists. The `main` repos are the same branch on every server.

**Every migrated repo's checkout lives at `~/apps/<app>`; `/opt/apps/<app>` is
`build-release.sh` output, NOT a repo.** Only imprivata-poc is still a
checkout under `/opt/apps` (acquisition-v2, the other one, was removed
2026-09-01 — see below).

| Repo | Branch on acq-vm-0 (staging) |
|---|---|
| data_acquisition, monday, part-source-pipeline, acumatica_sync, hhm_rpp_ge, hhm_rpp_philips, hhm_rpp_siemens, reports (**all migrated** — clone in `~/apps`) | `STAGING_docker` |
| redis-admin, pg_manage_v2 (**migrated** — clone in `~/apps`) | `STAGING` |
| incident-engine, ops-dashboard (**migrated** — clone in `~/apps`); imprivata-poc (checkout in `/opt/apps`) | `main` (no env branches) |
| odd-jobs | **not a git checkout on this box** — Jonathan deploys it; see PARTITION MAINTENANCE |

Other standing conventions:

- **Vendored `utils/`.** The shared library (logger, db, vpn, sh helpers) is vendored
  into each app repo. Never clone the old `AvanteHS-RTT/utils` repo. (Exception:
  acumatica_sync's `utils/` holds only its own `queries.js`.)
- **Per-app entrypoint.** The gosu user-drop entrypoint is baked into each app image
  from a tracked `docker/entrypoint.sh` or root `entrypoint.sh` (matrix below).
- **Run logs.** File-logger apps (data_acquisition, part-source-pipeline, the
  hhm_rpp trio): the logger always writes the fixed container path
  `./utils/logger/logs/`, and the compose mount `${LOG_DIR:-./utils/logger/logs}`
  decides the host destination — dev path by default (**fails safe**),
  `/opt/run-logs/<app>` in a release via `#RELEASE:LOG_DIR`. Apps without a file
  logger (monday, acumatica_sync, ops-dashboard, pg_manage_v2) keep their run
  record in a DB table or an owned logfile, with `RELEASE_SHA` provenance via the
  stamped `.env` + boot line. Every job app also self-logs a row into
  `util.app_run_logs` or `stats.job_runs` (that's what ops-dashboard and
  incident-engine read).
  *(Historical: the pre-paradigm logger switched on `RUN_ENV` — `dev` → in-repo,
  anything else **including unset** → `/opt/run-logs/` — i.e. it failed UNSAFE to
  the production path. `RUN_ENV` is retired fleet-wide since 2026-08-26; **most**
  apps' preflight warns if it reappears in an `.env` — but not all, see the
  retired-key caveat below.)*
- **`RUN_LOGS_DIR` format (RETIRED fleet-wide since 2026-08-26).** It was a **full
  `host:container` bind spec** consumed verbatim by a compose volume entry
  (`RUN_LOGS_DIR=/opt/run-logs/<app>:/opt/run-logs/<app>`); incident-engine, its last
  user, migrated to `LOG_DIR` above. If it reappears in an `.env`, most apps'
  preflight warns.
- **⚠️ The retired-key preflight backstop is NOT fleet-wide** (verified 2026-08-28).
  `data_acquisition`, `reports`, `incident-engine`, `part-source-pipeline`,
  `hhm_rpp_ge` and `acumatica_sync` check for retired keys; **`monday` and
  `ops-dashboard` do not**. That gap bites where it matters most: monday is the one
  app on this box where `RUN_ENV` actually survived the migration —
  `RUN_ENV='staging'` is still present in **both** `~/apps/monday/.env` and
  `/opt/apps/monday/.env`, and its preflight reports zero warnings about it. It is
  inert (monday has no file logger and nothing reads the variable), so this is
  cleanup, not breakage — but do not rely on preflight to find retired keys on a new
  server. Grep instead:
  `grep -lE '^(RUN_ENV|RUN_LOGS_DIR|NODE_MOD_CACHE_DEV|LOGGER)=' /opt/apps/*/.env ~/apps/*/.env`
- **Maintenance scripts live in the repo that owns their subject** (2026-08-18):
  database scripts in `pg_manage_v2/scripts/`, Redis scripts and host-setup files in
  `redis-admin/`, the cross-app run-log prune in `data_acquisition/scripts/`.
  `/opt/resources/scripts/` is **not** a script home anymore.
- **Secrets on disk follow the root-only-file pattern**: machine-generated value in a
  file under a `700 root:root` directory, owned by the container uid that must read
  it, bind-mounted as a single file. Host uid-999 (`dd-agent`) collides with the
  container `postgres`/`redis` uid — the root-only parent directory is what blocks it
  (SEC-06). Current instances: `/opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key`,
  `/opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf`.
- **Container log caps are per-service in tracked compose files** — `json-file`,
  `max-size: 10m`, `max-file: 3` on every long-running service (pg_db, the four
  Redis, ops-dashboard). Never via `/etc/docker/daemon.json`: a host file is exactly
  the kind of dependency a rebuild forgets, and the daemon restart it needs is not
  (OPS-02).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 1: INSTALL DOCKER

acq-vm-0 runs Docker 29.4.3 / Compose v5.1.3 installed via the apt repo. Record
`docker version` and `docker compose version` in the deployment notes when you build a
new server. (The recipe below is the classic keyring method; Docker's current docs use
a deb822 `docker.sources` file instead — either works, prefer the current official
method for new builds.)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### Optional: big-disk data root (ONLY if the VM has a second data disk)

acq-vm-0 has a single 2 TB root disk and uses the default `/var/lib/docker` — skip this
block there. On a VM with a data disk mounted at `/mnt/sdc` (verify: `df -h | grep sdc`,
and make sure it's in `/etc/fstab` so it mounts before Docker starts):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sdc/docker
sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
{ "data-root": "/mnt/sdc/docker" }
EOF
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir"    # expect /mnt/sdc/docker
```

> ⚠️ **Docker 29+ caveat:** fresh installs may use the containerd image store, whose
> content lives under `/var/lib/containerd` and is NOT moved by `data-root` alone.
> After the restart, pull an image and verify where the bytes actually land before
> trusting the migration.

# STEP 1.1: CREATE USERS

Two kinds of accounts, created differently:

```bash
# Admin users (repeat per human; both exist on acq-vm-0)
sudo adduser matt-teixeira
sudo adduser jonathan-pope
sudo usermod -aG docker matt-teixeira
sudo usermod -aG docker jonathan-pope
# Group membership takes effect on next login (or `newgrp docker` in the current shell).
# Note: membership in `docker` is root-equivalent on the host — admins only.

# Service account (jobs run as this identity inside containers)
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --group --shell /usr/sbin/nologin svc
sudo usermod -aG docker svc
# svc MUST be in the docker group: shared /opt dirs and the SSH bundle rely on
# group-docker permissions (verified live — jobs break without it).
```

Record the numeric ids — they feed every app's untracked `.env` (see Host identity
convention above; never bake them into tracked files):

```bash
id svc                  # acq-vm-0: uid=105
id matt-teixeira        # acq-vm-0: uid=1006
id jonathan-pope        # acq-vm-0: uid=1001
getent group docker     # acq-vm-0: gid=987
```

> The last hardcoded-id stragglers are gone (verified 2026-08-27): the
> incident-engine/ops-dashboard compose `user: "105:987"` pins were retired by
> their 2026-08-26 migrations (gosu entrypoint + `.env` build args), and reports'
> Dockerfile carries staging's numbers only in a comment. Host ids now come
> exclusively from each repo's untracked `.env` — on a new server, fill in this
> host's values and run each app's write-permission smoke test.

# STEP 1.2: SHARED RESOURCE PERMISSIONS

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/run-logs /opt/apps /opt/resources
for d in /opt/run-logs /opt/apps /opt/resources; do
  sudo chgrp docker "$d"
  sudo chmod 2775 "$d"        # setgid: new files inherit group docker
done
```

# STEP 1.3: DEFAULT ACLs

```bash
sudo apt install -y acl
for d in /opt/run-logs /opt/apps /opt/resources; do
  sudo setfacl -d -m g:docker:rwX "$d"
  sudo setfacl -m g:docker:rwX "$d"
done
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 1.4: GIT, GITHUB ACCESS & THE INFRA CLONES

Nothing below works without git, a database client, and the ability to clone the
private repos — a blank VM has none of these (audit A21-01/03/13).

```bash
sudo apt install -y git postgresql-client

# Docker group membership from STEP 1.1 is NOT active in your current shell yet.
# STEP 1.4 below runs build-release.sh, which calls docker — activate it first, or
# every docker command here fails with "permission denied ... docker.sock":
id -nG | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -qx docker && echo "docker group active" || \
  echo "NOT in docker group — run 'newgrp docker' or re-login before continuing"
# `newgrp docker` starts a SUBSHELL: run it on its own, then carry on inside that
# shell (don't paste it mid-script — everything after it would run in the subshell).

git config --global user.email "you.guy@avantehs.com"
git config --global user.name  "You Guy"

# GitHub access: enroll a key for this server (or restore the previous server's
# deploy key from the secret store into ~/.ssh/).
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$(whoami)@$(hostname)"
# Add the public key to GitHub (account key or per-repo deploy keys), then:
ssh -T git@github.com    # accept github.com's host key AFTER checking its
                         # fingerprint against https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
                         # /keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints
```

Clone the two infra repos now — STEP 2 (database) and STEP 3 (Redis) run compose
from inside them, before the app-repo steps:

```bash
# BOTH infra repos are paradigm-migrated (pg_manage_v2 2026-08-26, redis-admin
# 2026-08-27): the editable clone lives in ~/apps and /opt/apps/<repo> is
# BUILD OUTPUT — never a git checkout.
git clone -b <branch per the identity table> git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/redis-admin.git ~/apps/redis-admin
# create ~/apps/redis-admin/.env from .env.example, then produce the release copy:
cd ~/apps/redis-admin && bash build-release.sh      # STEP 3 runs compose from the release copy

git clone -b <branch per the identity table> git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/pg_manage_v2.git ~/apps/pg_manage_v2
# create ~/apps/pg_manage_v2/.env from .env.example, then produce the release copy:
cd ~/apps/pg_manage_v2 && bash build-release.sh     # STEP 2 runs compose from the release copy
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 1.5: DATABASE TLS MATERIAL (must exist before STEP 2)

STEP 2's compose binds the cert and key **long-form with `create_host_path: false`**,
so `docker compose up -d` **fails immediately** if they do not exist yet. Generate
them here, before the database step — nothing between this point and STEP 2 creates
them.

Full detail, the reasoning behind the permission layout, and the regeneration
procedure live in **DATABASE SSL SETUP** (below, before DATABASE ROLES); this is the
minimum needed to get past STEP 2. `<VM_IP>` is this host's primary address
(`hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'` — on acq-vm-0, `10.2.0.4`); it must appear in the
SAN or external `verify-full` clients fail with `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`.

```bash
sudo install -d -m 2775 -g docker /opt/resources/ssl
sudo install -d -m 700  -o root -g root /opt/resources/ssl/private

openssl genrsa -out /tmp/pg_ssl.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 1095 \
  -key /tmp/pg_ssl.key \
  -out /tmp/pg_ssl.crt \
  -subj "/CN=pg_db" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:pg_db,DNS:postgres-server,DNS:localhost,IP:<VM_IP>,IP:127.0.0.1"

sudo install -m 644 -g docker /tmp/pg_ssl.crt /opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt
sudo install -m 600 -o 999 -g root /tmp/pg_ssl.key /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key
rm -f /tmp/pg_ssl.key /tmp/pg_ssl.crt        # 999 = container postgres uid (SEC-06)

# Confirm both exist with the right modes before running STEP 2:
sudo ls -l /opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key
openssl x509 -in /opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt -noout -dates -ext subjectAltName
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 2: DATABASE (pg_db — tracked compose, pg_manage_v2/infra/pg_db)

The database container is **defined in git**: `pg_manage_v2/infra/pg_db/
docker-compose.yaml`, with its recreate procedure in `RUNBOOK.md` beside it (executed
2026-08-18; SEC-05/06, DB-04/06). Never `docker run` it by hand again.

> **☠️ Compose lifecycle commands run ONLY from `/opt/apps/pg_manage_v2`** — the same
> hazard redis-admin carries (STEP 3), for the same reason. The compose file pins
> `name: pg-infra` (a fixed project name, **not** derived from the directory) and
> `container_name: pg_db`, and the dev clone's copy is byte-identical to the release's.
> So `docker compose up -d` / `down` / `restart` from `~/apps/pg_manage_v2` resolves to
> the **same project and the same running container** — a `down` there stops
> PRODUCTION Postgres and takes every app on `pg_net` with it. Dev-side validation is
> containerless: `docker compose config --quiet`. The only exception is the
> new-server initialization in this step, where no production database exists yet.

What the tracked definition provides:
- reuses the **external** named volume `postgres_data` and network `pg_net` — a
  container swap never touches data;
- **no password in container metadata** (SEC-05): postgres:16 only requires
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD*` when initializing an *empty* volume — on a running server the
  role password lives in the database catalog (rotate with `\password`, never in
  compose). The compose file carries commented-out secret plumbing for the
  new-server case only;
- TLS cert/key bind-mounted **long-form with `create_host_path: false`** (a missing
  key fails `up` loudly instead of Docker fabricating an empty directory — REL-09);
- healthcheck (`pg_isready`), `shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements` (DB-06),
  and the standard log cap.

### New server, empty volume

```bash
docker network create pg_net
docker volume create postgres_data

# Superuser password: root-only file, generated, never typed or displayed
sudo install -m 600 -o root -g root /dev/null /root/pg_superuser_pw
sudo sh -c 'head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -d "/+=" | head -c 32 > /root/pg_superuser_pw'

# TLS material must already exist (STEP 1.5) — create_host_path:false means
# `up -d` fails loudly without it.
#
# The environment:/secrets: blocks (POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE) are commented out in the
# tracked compose; initialization genuinely needs them. Edit them in the DEV CLONE
# and release — /opt/apps is build output, and build-release.sh refuses a dirty tree,
# so editing the release copy directly is both a paradigm violation and unreleasable.
cd ~/apps/pg_manage_v2
$EDITOR infra/pg_db/docker-compose.yaml       # uncomment environment: + secrets:
git commit -am "pg_db: enable POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE for empty-volume init"
bash build-release.sh

cd /opt/apps/pg_manage_v2/infra/pg_db         # release copy — compose runs from here
docker compose config --quiet && docker compose up -d

until docker exec pg_db pg_isready -U postgres -q; do sleep 1; done && echo ready
docker exec -it pg_db psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE <DB_NAME>;   -- dev / staging / prod per the identity table"

# Then RE-COMMENT the secret blocks and recreate once, so the running container
# carries no password reference (SEC-05). Same route — clone, commit, release:
cd ~/apps/pg_manage_v2
$EDITOR infra/pg_db/docker-compose.yaml       # re-comment environment: + secrets:
git commit -am "pg_db: re-comment secret plumbing post-init (SEC-05)"
bash build-release.sh
(cd /opt/apps/pg_manage_v2/infra/pg_db && docker compose up -d)

# Keep /root/pg_superuser_pw as the break-glass copy. Verify no password reference
# survives in the running container:
docker inspect pg_db | grep -c POSTGRES_PASSWORD      # expect 0
```

> **Why two commits.** The uncomment/re-comment pair is a genuine round-trip through
> git — that is the cost of the paradigm, not a mistake. `build-release.sh` enforces
> a clean-tree guard (`ERROR: working tree is dirty — refusing to release`), so there
> is no supported way to toggle these blocks only in `/opt/apps`. Do **not** reach for
> `--allow-dirty` here: it would stamp a `RELEASE_SHA` that matches no commit, which
> is exactly the provenance guarantee the paradigm exists to provide. On a
> **new-server build these two commits are throwaway** — squash or revert them once
> the volume is initialized, or keep them on a short-lived branch.

**This stack uses a single `<DB_NAME>` database for every app** — do not also create
the *other* server type's name (a `dev` database on staging, a `staging` database on
dev): a second database that nothing should point at is exactly how an app ends up
silently pointed at empty tables (the pre-August monday failure).

### Existing server (container swap / config change)

Follow `pg_manage_v2/infra/pg_db/RUNBOOK.md`. Short form: fresh backup verified →
`docker stop pg_db && docker rm pg_db` → `docker compose up -d` → the runbook's
verification gates (healthy; zero `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `docker inspect`; `SELECT 1`;
non-SSL rejected; dd-agent denied on the key; one cron cycle lands in
`util.app_run_logs`). Downtime is under a minute; the volume is external.

### Enforce SSL-only (pg_hba — once per new volume)

```bash
docker exec -it pg_db cp /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf.bak
docker exec -it pg_db sed -i 's/^host all all all scram-sha-256/hostssl all all all scram-sha-256/' \
  /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf
docker exec -it pg_db psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_reload_conf();"
# Verify the edit took (exactly one hostssl catch-all, no errors):
docker exec -it pg_db psql -U postgres -c "SELECT line_number, type, database, user_name, address, auth_method, error FROM pg_hba_file_rules;"
```

The stock `trust` rules for the local socket and loopback (127.0.0.1/::1) above the
catch-all are **retained deliberately**: every `docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres`
maintenance command in this document relies on them, and loopback inside the
container is only reachable with docker-group access, which is root-equivalent on
the host anyway. Do not "harden" them away — the `hostssl` catch-all is the rule
governing network clients (audit A21-14).

### Query statistics (DB-06)

`pg_stat_statements` is preloaded by the tracked compose. Enable it once per database:

```bash
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;"
```

# STEP 3: REDIS (redis-admin — ports off, auth on)

> **redis-admin is MIGRATED (2026-08-27, admin-repo subset — see its CLAUDE.md,
> authoritative for conventions and hazards).** Editable clone `~/apps/redis-admin`
> (branch `STAGING`); `/opt/apps/redis-admin` is `build-release.sh` output
> (clean-tree guard, `RELEASE_SHA` stamped; the compose file carries it onto every
> container as label `com.redis-admin.release_sha`, failing safe to `dev-tree`).
> **☠️ Compose lifecycle commands run ONLY from `/opt/apps/redis-admin`**: both
> copies resolve to the same compose project with fixed `container_name`s and
> static IPs, so an `up`/`down`/`restart` from the dev clone operates on the four
> PRODUCTION containers and re-points their config mounts at the dev tree. Dev-side
> validation is containerless (`bash preflight-check.sh`, `docker compose config`).
> A release is two steps: `build-release.sh` (touches no container), then apply
> per instance from the release copy in a quiet cron window (spare → PROD →
> STAGING → dev-0-4 last; changed config-file *contents* need
> `--force-recreate`/`restart` — compose won't recreate on its own).

**The standard build is all four instances together** — one `docker compose up -d`
in redis-admin creates the full set on the dedicated `redis-admin_redis_net` bridge.
Never bring up a subset; apps and odd-jobs resolve these by container name:

| Instance | Consumers | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `redis_dev-0-4` | the four job apps (live acquisition state) | **required** |
| `redis-PROD` | none currently | **required** |
| `redis_dev-0-5` | none (spare) | **required** |
| `redis-STAGING` | **odd-jobs** | **required** (standardized 2026-08-19 — see odd-jobs caveat below) |

**No host ports are published** (REDIS-01): everything reaches Redis over the docker
network. Auth: **all four instances** load `requirepass` at boot from a root-only
host file via an `include` in their tracked configs (REDIS-01 rollout 2026-08-18;
extended to `redis-STAGING` 2026-08-19). ⚠️ odd-jobs caveat: redis-STAGING's
consumer is odd-jobs, whose Redis client historically had **no auth support** —
the pre-2026-08-19 exception existed for it. An unauthenticated client fails fast
with NOAUTH; coordinate odd-jobs' connectivity with Jonathan.

Order matters and is proven, not theoretical: **a client configured with a password
against a passwordless server hangs in an infinite reconnect loop** (node-redis v4,
tested 2026-08-18); the reverse fails fast with a clean NOAUTH error. So on any
rollout or rollback: **server first, app `.env`s immediately after.**

```bash
# 1. Kernel settings Redis needs (once per host; files are tracked in the repo —
#    cloned to ~/apps and released to /opt/apps in STEP 1.4)
cd /opt/apps/redis-admin
sudo cp host-setup/90-redis.conf /etc/sysctl.d/ && sudo sysctl --system
sudo cp host-setup/disable-thp.service /etc/systemd/system/ && sudo systemctl enable --now disable-thp.service

# 2. Auth secret FIRST — compose fails loudly without it (create_host_path: false)
sudo install -d -m 700 -o root -g root /opt/resources/secrets
sudo sh -c 'umask 277; printf "requirepass %s\n" "$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -d "/+=" | head -c 32)" > /opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf'
sudo chown 999:root /opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf   # 999 = container redis uid; the 700 dir blocks host uid-999 (dd-agent)
sudo chmod 400 /opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf

# 3. Instances up
# .env (gitignored; keys per .env.example: REDIS_SUBNET, REDIS_GATEWAY,
# REDIS_{PROD,STAGING,DEV04,DEV05}_IP) is created in the DEV CLONE and arrives
# here via build-release.sh, RELEASE_SHA-stamped.
docker compose config --quiet && docker compose up -d
docker compose ps        # all four (healthy) — healthchecks authenticate and demand a literal PONG

# The generated password is now the ONLY credential the instances accept, and every
# consuming app MUST carry it as REDIS_PW in its untracked .env. Read it when needed:
sudo cat /opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf   # value after "requirepass"

# 4. Give the consuming apps the password (after their .envs exist — see app steps).
# Prefer the script over hand-copying — it propagates REDIS_PW and verifies auth
# end-to-end without echoing the value. Run it from the RELEASE copy:
cd /opt/apps/redis-admin && sudo scripts/activate_redis_auth.sh
```

>   [ -f "$f" ] && { grep -q '^REDIS_PW=.\+' "$f" && echo "ok   $f" || echo "MISS $f"; }
> done
> ```

**Verify the configs actually loaded** — not optional. Compose bind-mounts
`./config/<name>.config` over `/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf` long-form with
`create_host_path: false`. (History: the mounts once pointed at nonexistent paths;
Docker auto-created empty dirs and Redis silently ran on defaults with AOF off for
months. Fixed 2026-07-27; the fail-loud mount style exists because of it.)

```bash
for r in redis-PROD redis-STAGING redis_dev-0-4 redis_dev-0-5; do
  echo "$r: $(docker exec $r sh -c 'redis-cli -a "$(awk "/^requirepass/{print \$2}" /usr/local/etc/redis/auth.conf)" --no-auth-warning CONFIG GET appendonly' | tail -1)"   # expect yes
done
docker exec redis_dev-0-4 redis-cli PING    # expect NOAUTH error — auth is live
ss -ltn | grep -E ':(6379|6380|6381|6382)' || echo "no redis host listeners (correct)"
```

**Human access** (redis-cli never prompts — it connects, then refuses commands until
you authenticate; full patterns in redis-admin README → Connecting):

```bash
docker exec -it redis_dev-0-4 sh -c 'redis-cli -a "$(awk "/^requirepass/{print \$2}" /usr/local/etc/redis/auth.conf)" --no-auth-warning'
sudo cat /opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf     # the value itself, for GUI clients etc.
```

# STEP 4: SEED REDIS STATE (new server only)

Rescoped: this seeds a **new dev/staging server** from an existing source; it is not a
production cutover runbook (none exists yet — write and rehearse one before any PROD
build).

```bash
# On the SOURCE server — the script is tracked as data_acquisition/scripts/
# redis_migrate.sh (since 2026-08-20); copy it over or run it from a checkout.
#
# PREREQUISITE (undocumented until 2026-08-28): the script hardcodes
#   REMOTE="data-acqu-vm-staging"
# — an ssh alias that must already exist in the SOURCE server's ~/.ssh/config with a
# working key to THIS target. STEP 1.4 only enrolls a GitHub key; this is a separate,
# host-to-host trust. Edit REMOTE for any target other than acq-vm-0. The sibling
# scripts/known_hosts_migrate.sh (STEP 5.8, SHARED SSH BUNDLE) hardcodes the same
# alias at line 30. Verify before running: ssh <alias> true
./redis_migrate.sh                      # ships latest RDB to ~/redis_dumps/ on the target

# On the target server:
DUMP=$(ls -t ~/redis_dumps/redis-PROD-dump-*.rdb | head -1)

# GUARD: validate the dump BEFORE stopping anything or touching a volume. Without
# this, an absent/empty dump still runs the destructive step below and leaves you
# with empty volumes and no original (the rm precedes the cp).
[ -s "$DUMP" ] || { echo "FATAL: no non-empty dump found in ~/redis_dumps"; exit 1; }
echo "Loading: $DUMP ($(stat -c%s "$DUMP") bytes)"

# SOURCE_KEYS: the number this seed must reproduce. Capture it ON THE SOURCE server
# before migrating (redis_migrate.sh does not emit it — FOLLOW-UPS 19):
#   docker exec redis-PROD sh -c 'redis-cli -a "$(awk "/^requirepass/{print \$2}" \
#     /usr/local/etc/redis/auth.conf)" --no-auth-warning DBSIZE'
# Set it here; every DBSIZE check below is compared against it automatically.
SOURCE_KEYS=<count from the source server>

# Stop targets BEFORE touching their volumes (a running Redis rewrites its RDB on
# shutdown and would clobber the seed):
docker stop redis-PROD redis-STAGING redis_dev-0-4

for pair in redis-PROD:prod_data redis-STAGING:staging_data redis_dev-0-4:dev04_data; do
  name=${pair%%:*}; vol=redis-admin_${pair##*:}

  # 1. COPY FIRST, THEN SWAP — never delete before the replacement is in place.
  #    The copy lands beside the live data as dump.rdb.new; only once it has
  #    arrived intact do we clear the AOF and move it into position. A failed or

    || { echo "FATAL: seed copy failed for $name — volume left as-is"; exit 1; }

  # 2. Load it in a throwaway server with AOF OFF (the only state in which
  #    dump.rdb is actually read), then convert the loaded dataset to AOF:
  docker run -d --rm --name seed -v $vol:/data redis:7-alpine \
    redis-server --appendonly no --save ''
  until docker exec seed redis-cli PING 2>/dev/null | grep -q PONG; do sleep 1; done

  # ASSERT, don't eyeball: the loaded key count must equal the source.
  LOADED=$(docker exec seed redis-cli DBSIZE)
  if [ "$LOADED" != "$SOURCE_KEYS" ]; then
    echo "FATAL: $name loaded $LOADED keys, expected $SOURCE_KEYS"
    docker stop seed; exit 1

  echo "$name: $LOADED keys OK"

  docker exec seed redis-cli CONFIG SET appendonly yes
  docker exec seed redis-cli INFO persistence | grep aof_rewrite_in_progress  # expect :0
  docker stop seed                       # --rm removes it

  # 3. The real container now boots from the generated AOF manifest:
  docker start $name
done

# Final check: DBSIZE per instance (all four are auth'd — use the -a pattern from
# STEP 3) must equal $SOURCE_KEYS. dev-0-5 (spare) is deliberately left empty.
# The loop already asserted this per instance; this confirms it survived the
# AOF conversion and the real container's boot.
```

> ⚠️ **Why the temp-server dance instead of `docker cp` + start** (rehearsed
> 2026-08-19): after STEP 3 the targets have ALWAYS already run with AOF enabled —
> the tracked configs say `appendonly yes`, so first boot creates `appendonlydir/`

> the once-documented "fix" of deleting `appendonlydir/` before starting is worse:
> per REDIS-05, `appendonly yes` with no AOF manifest boots EMPTY without reading
> `dump.rdb` at all. The dump is only loaded by a server started with

# STEP 5: DATABASE SCHEMA & DATA SEEDING (pg_manage_v2)

```bash
cd /opt/apps/pg_manage_v2        # release copy, produced by build-release.sh in STEP 1.4
# .env (with SRC_* Azure source and DST_* local pg_db vars) arrived from the dev
# clone's copy, transformed + RELEASE_SHA-stamped by build-release.sh.
docker build -t pg_manage .      # operator-built; deliberately NOT identity-tagged
```

This repo also owns the pg_db runtime definition (`infra/pg_db/` — STEP 2) and the
database maintenance scripts (`scripts/backup.sh`, `scripts/check-partition-horizon.sh`
— see BACKUPS and PARTITION MAINTENANCE).

### 5.1 Copy schemas/tables (structure + triggers/constraints/indexes/views/sequences)

```bash
docker run --rm --network pg_net --env-file .env -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  --entrypoint bash pg_manage -lc './scripts/azure_to_local_migration/1_pgdump_tables_to_local.sh'
```

### 5.2 Copy table data (batch groups set in .env)

```bash
docker run --rm --network pg_net --env-file .env -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  --entrypoint bash pg_manage -lc './scripts/azure_to_local_migration/2_pgdump_data_to_local.sh'
```

### 5.3 Date-constrained data

```bash
# Manual timeframe:
docker run --rm --network pg_net --env-file .env -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  --entrypoint bash pg_manage -lc './scripts/azure_to_local_migration/3_pgdump_data_to_local_time_cond.sh'
# Month-to-date (first minute of current month → now):
docker run --rm --network pg_net --env-file .env -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  --entrypoint bash pg_manage -lc './scripts/azure_to_local_migration/4_pgdump_data_to_local_month_to_date.sh'
```

### 5.4 Verify before pointing jobs at it

```bash
# Spot-check row counts per critical table against the source, e.g.:
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -c "SELECT count(*) FROM alert.models;"
```

A host-side `psql -h localhost -U postgres` **prompts for a password and fails
non-interactively** (`fe_sendauth: no password supplied`) — the superuser password is
in `/root/pg_superuser_pw`, not in your environment. Use `docker exec` for counting
rows, as above: it is a read-only query against the catalog, so the loopback-trust
caveat below does not affect the answer.

> ⚠️ **`docker exec pg_db psql` is NOT a credential test.** pg_hba keeps `trust` on
> the local socket and loopback (deliberately — see STEP 2), so that command connects
> **even with a deliberately wrong password**. It is fine for DDL, config and row
> counts; it can never tell you whether an app's credentials work. To actually verify
> a credential, connect the way an app does — from a sibling container over `pg_net`,

> ```bash
> docker run --rm --network pg_net -e PGPASSWORD='<password>' postgres:16 \
>   psql -h pg_db -U <role> -d <DB_NAME> -tAc "SELECT 1"
> ```
> This is the pattern every app's `preflight-check.sh` already uses.

### 5.5 The systems inventory drifts — decide the sync policy (B0a)

`public.systems` (and its flags: active systems, credentials, host IPs) was seeded
once and then **drifts silently from prod**: prod retires/adds systems and staging
never hears about it. Two consequences observed in August: staging polled 6 systems
prod had retired, and prod still lists 14 systems dark since July 7. **Before relying
on a rebuilt server, reconcile the inventory against prod and record the delta** —
snapshot pattern: `/opt/resources/backups/systems-flags-snapshot-<date>.txt`. A named,
scheduled sync (or an explicit "manual, on change" policy with an owner) is an open
decision; the acceptance test includes the check either way.

### 5.6 Table updates changelog

Schema changes made on this stack **after** the source data was seeded, kept here in
one place **so they can be applied to a freshly seeded server** (in particular: run
this against the prod database when the prod server is initiated). Already applied to
acq-vm-0. Apply in one pass with `ON_ERROR_STOP`; note that
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` make the block re-runnable
but never *upgrade* an existing table whose shape drifted — verify, don't assume.

When a future schema change lands, **append it here** (dated) — this section is the
single changelog that a new server's seeded database gets replayed against.

### 5.7 Re-encrypt migrated credentials (every seed — learned the hard way 2026-08-20)

Seeded `hhm_credentials` rows are ciphertext under the **source server's legacy
scheme**; this server's jobs decrypt with the AES/`APP_SECRET` scheme. Until
converted, every credentialed HHM acquisition fails with
`Invalid authentication tag length: 0` (the 2026-08-19 migration ran ~20 h in that
state — 9 systems succeeding instead of ~65). After seeding, snapshot then convert:

```bash
docker exec pg_db pg_dump -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -t hhm_credentials -Fc \
  > /opt/resources/backups/pg/hhm_credentials-pre-reencrypt-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).dump
cd /opt/apps/data_acquisition && ./run_scripts/update_db_creds.sh   # see STEP 8
```

Run it **exactly once per seed** — it has no already-converted guard, and a second
run would feed new-format ciphertext to the legacy decryptor and destroy the
credentials (old format = uniform 32-char values; converted = 68–80 chars —
`SELECT length(password_enc), count(*) FROM hhm_credentials GROUP BY 1` tells you
which state you're in). Its stdout prints decrypted credentials — private terminal,
no redirection. Verify on the next cron burst: zero `credential_decrypt` errors in
`util.app_run_logs`.

### 5.8 Import production host keys (every seed that carries systems inventory)

A migrated inventory references hosts this server may never have keyed; strict host-key
checking then fails those systems every cycle (2026-08-19: 905
`No ED25519 host key is known` errors in 17 h). **Before the first cron burst after
seeding**, push the source server's verified `known_hosts` — run
`scripts/known_hosts_migrate.sh` **on the source server** (dry-run first). Full
procedure and verification: SHARED SSH BUNDLE → "Incremental import after a migration".

### 5.9 Re-provision app DB schemas & roles (every reseed — learned the hard way 2026-08-21)

> **NEW-SERVER BUILD: skip this section on the first pass and come back to it.**
> Every command below reads files that do not exist yet — `/opt/apps/<app>/.env` and
> `<app>/db/*.sql` for incident-engine, ops-dashboard and reports, which are not
> deployed until their sections much later in this document (INCIDENT-ENGINE,
> OPS-DASHBOARD, REPORTS). Each of those sections provisions its own role at the
> right moment, so a first build needs nothing here. Return to 5.9 **only** when
> re-seeding a server whose apps are already deployed — that is the case it was
> written for (the 2026-08-19 reseed). Order within it still matters:
> incident-engine before ops-dashboard.

Recreating schemas/tables **destroys every grant on them**, and app-owned schemas
that don't exist in the source DB (`incidents`) vanish entirely. Roles survive (they
are cluster-level) — which makes the breakage *silent*: after the 2026-08-19 reseed,
incident-engine failed every run for two days (`permission denied for schema util`,
unable to even self-log to the DB), ops-dashboard served data frozen at the pre-wipe
timestamp while returning 200s (`"stale":"last refresh failed: permission denied"`
in the payload), and reports_rw sat broken-but-latent (no schedule on this box).

**Step 0 — make sure the role password files exist.** The scripts read each role's
password from a root-only file (`/root/<role>_pw`, DATABASE ROLES pattern). These
files are host state — a rebuilt/never-provisioned host won't have them (found
missing on acq-vm-0, 2026-08-21 — **and missing AGAIN as of 2026-08-28**:
`sudo ls -l /root/*_pw` returns "No such file or directory", so this is a recurrence,
not a one-off. Nothing is broken while apps run — they authenticate from their own
`.env` — but **every `setup-role.sql` re-run will fail at Step 0 until they are
recreated**, which is exactly the reseed path below. Recreate them now rather than
discovering it mid-reseed; if they vanish a third time, find out what removes them).
No password is lost when they're absent: the live
value is in each app's untracked `.env`. Recreate them from there — values flow
through pipes only, never shell history or `ps`, and **nothing is rotated** (the
scripts will re-set each role to the password the apps already use):

```bash
sudo ls -l /root/incident_engine_rw_pw /root/ops_dashboard_ro_pw /root/ops_dashboard_rw_pw /root/reports_rw_pw
# For any file MISSING (source key is PGPASSWORD, except the ops-dashboard
# writer, which lives in PG_WRITER_PASSWORD):
sudo install -m 600 -o root -g root /dev/null /root/incident_engine_rw_pw
grep '^PGPASSWORD=' /opt/apps/incident-engine/.env | cut -d= -f2- | sudo tee /root/incident_engine_rw_pw >/dev/null
sudo install -m 600 -o root -g root /dev/null /root/ops_dashboard_ro_pw
grep '^PGPASSWORD=' /opt/apps/ops-dashboard/.env | cut -d= -f2- | sudo tee /root/ops_dashboard_ro_pw >/dev/null
sudo install -m 600 -o root -g root /dev/null /root/ops_dashboard_rw_pw
grep '^PG_WRITER_PASSWORD=' /opt/apps/ops-dashboard/.env | cut -d= -f2- | sudo tee /root/ops_dashboard_rw_pw >/dev/null
sudo install -m 600 -o root -g root /dev/null /root/reports_rw_pw
grep '^PGPASSWORD=' /opt/apps/reports/.env | cut -d= -f2- | sudo tee /root/reports_rw_pw >/dev/null
sudo sh -c 'wc -c /root/*_pw'    # every file non-empty (~20-50 bytes) before proceeding
```

**Steps 1–5 — re-run the provisioning scripts, in this order** (incident-engine
before ops-dashboard: its role script grants SELECT on `incidents.*`; the writer
role is required whenever ops-dashboard runs `SELF_LOG_ENABLED=true`, which is the
standard config). Stop on any `ERROR` line; the reports script is non-transactional
(DB-03) — read a midway error rather than re-running blind:

```bash
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -f - < /opt/apps/incident-engine/db/schema.sql
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v pw="$(sudo cat /root/incident_engine_rw_pw)" -f - < /opt/apps/incident-engine/db/setup-owner-role.sql
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v ro_pw="$(sudo cat /root/ops_dashboard_ro_pw)" < /opt/apps/ops-dashboard/db/setup-readonly-role.sql
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v rw_pw="$(sudo cat /root/ops_dashboard_rw_pw)" < /opt/apps/ops-dashboard/db/setup-writer-role.sql
# reports: DDL FIRST (2026-08-31). setup-role.sql now names alert.sme_report_sends
# and its sequence directly; on a freshly reseeded DB those objects do not exist
# yet and the script — being non-transactional — would stop midway. The DDL is
# repeatable, so this is a no-op wherever the tables already exist.
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f - < /opt/apps/reports/sql/sme_reports_config.sql
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v pw="$(sudo cat /root/reports_rw_pw)" -f - < /opt/apps/reports/db/setup-role.sql
```

**Verify** (executed and confirmed on acq-vm-0, 2026-08-21) — note each role's
*intended* shape differs; test what it should have, not blanket SELECT:

```bash
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -tAc "
SELECT r, has_schema_privilege(r,'util','USAGE'),
       has_table_privilege(r,'util.app_run_logs','SELECT'),
       has_table_privilege(r,'util.app_run_logs','INSERT')
FROM unnest(ARRAY['incident_engine_rw','ops_dashboard_ro','reports_rw']) r"
# expect: incident_engine_rw t|t|f · ops_dashboard_ro t|t|f · reports_rw t|f|t
# reports also needs its sme_reports write path intact (2026-08-31) — the
# sequence grant is the one that fails at RUNTIME rather than at deploy:
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -tAc "
SELECT has_table_privilege('reports_rw','alert.sme_report_sends','INSERT'),
       has_sequence_privilege('reports_rw','alert.sme_report_sends_id_seq','USAGE'),
       has_any_column_privilege('reports_rw','public.users','SELECT'),
       has_table_privilege('reports_rw','public.users','SELECT'),
       has_table_privilege('reports_rw','public.hhm_credentials','SELECT')"
# expect: t|t|t|f|f  (column-level on users: any-column TRUE, whole-table FALSE;
#          hhm_credentials must stay unreachable)
# (reports_rw is INSERT-not-SELECT by design; ops_dashboard_rw has NO table
#  grants by design — it only executes the writer function:)
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -tAc "
SELECT has_function_privilege('ops_dashboard_rw','ops.log_ops_dashboard_run(uuid,json,json)','EXECUTE')"   # t
```

Then: the next `:25/:55` incident-engine run logs an outcome to `util.app_run_logs`,
and ops-dashboard's `/api/jobs/latest` shows a current `asOf` with no `stale` field
(its refresh recovers unaided within minutes). This list must grow with the
DATABASE ROLES rollout — add a Step-0 line and a script line here for every future
role.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 6: DATA ACQUISITION APP SETUP (paradigm — migrated 2026-08-24)

data_acquisition follows the dev/release paradigm: the checkout goes in the
operator's home, and `/opt/apps/data_acquisition` is produced by `build-release.sh`,
never cloned. Full conventions: the repo's own `CLAUDE.md` +
`docs/migration_CLAUDE.md` Parts 1+3.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/apps
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/data_acquisition.git ~/apps/data_acquisition
cd ~/apps/data_acquisition
git switch -c STAGING_docker --track origin/STAGING_docker
```

### 6.1 `.env`

Copy from the previous server / secret store into the CLONE; `build-release.sh`
transforms a copy of it for the release. Full key list (names; values from the
secret store; template with `#RELEASE:` markers = tracked `.env.example`):

```
APP_NAME USER_ID LOGGER_MODE LOG_DIR APP_SECRET      # identity keys carry #RELEASE: overrides
PGHOST PGPORT PGDATABASE PGUSER PGPASSWORD PG_SSLMODE PG_SSL_PATH
REDIS_HOST REDIS_PORT REDIS_PW
DATA_STORE_DEV SSH_KEY
UID_0 UID_1 UID_2 DOCKER_GID
SRC_* DST_* (migration passthrough)  VNS3_IP VNS3_PW  PHILIPS_MRI_SHELL_TIMEOUT_S
```

Retired keys — do not reintroduce: `IMAGE_TAG`, `RUN_ENV`, `RUN_LOGS_DIR`,
`NODE_MOD_CACHE_DEV`, `LOGGER`, pinned `RUN_USER`. Key values on acq-vm-0:
`USER_ID=<your-username>` (+ `#RELEASE:USER_ID=svc`), `LOG_DIR=./utils/logger/logs`
(+ `#RELEASE:LOG_DIR=/opt/run-logs/data_acquisition`), `PGDATABASE=staging` (this
server's <DB_NAME>), `PGHOST=pg_db`, `REDIS_HOST=redis_dev-0-4`, `REDIS_PW` mirrors
`/opt/resources/secrets/redis_auth.conf` (set by `activate_redis_auth.sh`, STEP 3),
`DATA_STORE_DEV=/opt/resources/acqu_files`, `UID_0/1/2` + `DOCKER_GID` from STEP 1.1.

### 6.2 Build (dev) and release

The repo carries an allowlist `.dockerignore` (SEC-10) — the build context admits
only the Dockerfile + entrypoint, and `.env`, `.git`, and logs can never land in an
image. No shared cache to warm: `build.sh` installs `node_modules` **in-tree, per
copy**.

```bash
bash preflight-check.sh    # authenticated Redis + sibling-container Postgres checks; expect 0 warnings
bash build.sh              # in-tree npm install + docker compose build -> data-acqu:<username>
bash build-release.sh      # guard -> mirror to /opt/apps -> #RELEASE flips -> RELEASE_SHA stamp
                           #   -> builds data-acqu:svc (refuses a dirty tree; that is the point)
```

### 6.3 Run a job

```bash
# dev, from the clone, as yourself:
RUN_USER=<you> docker compose run --rm app_tools node index.js offline_alert
# production shape (what cron runs), from the release copy:
cd /opt/apps/data_acquisition && docker compose run --rm -T app_tools node index.js <group> [args]
```

Cron entries use direct `node index.js` argv with `flock -n` and bounded `.out`
files — recorded in `cron-bk/crontab.restore-2026-08-24.cron`. Verify any run from
`util.app_run_logs`: production rows read `svc | <RELEASE_SHA>`; `dev-tree` on a
schedule means cron is running the wrong copy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE OUTCOME CONTRACT — jobs fail loudly (run_outcome/v1, OPS-03)

Every job app (data_acquisition, hhm_rpp_ge/philips/siemens, part-source-pipeline,
reports) ends **every run** with a terminal `run_outcome` event and an honest exit
code. This is the foundation the dashboards, incident-engine, and all future alerting
stand on — never reintroduce a catch that logs and reports success.

| Exit | Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `success` | zero ERROR events (or an explicitly `skipped` run, e.g. lock-busy) |
| 1 | `failed`  | a fatal error escaped to the top-level catch |
| 2 | `partial` | tolerated per-system ERROR events, or self-log persistence failed |
| 3 | usage     | unknown run group — operator must fix the crontab |

Semantics: per-system failures (an offline site, one bad credential group) are caught
by the job's own per-unit catches, logged as ERROR events, and yield `partial` —
the run itself keeps going. A **fatal** is anything that escapes to `onBoot`'s catch.
The `run_outcome` event is type INFO **on purpose** — it must never land in
`warn_error_logs` (ops-dashboard derives status and incident-engine materializes
incidents from that column). Exit codes are set via `process.exitCode`, never
`process.exit()` (lets I/O flush). If the self-log cannot be persisted to **both** DB
and disk, the run refuses to report clean success.

Quick health read across the fleet:

```sql
-- Per-app outcome tally for the last hour, PLUS an explicit count of rows that
-- could not be parsed. Never silently drops a row: an unreadable log is reported,
-- not hidden (same principle as the outcome contract itself).
WITH src AS (
  SELECT app_name, verbose_log,
         (verbose_log::text LIKE '%\u0000%') AS unreadable
  FROM util.app_run_logs
  WHERE inserted_at > now() - interval '1 hour'
)
SELECT app_name, e->'note'->>'outcome' AS outcome, count(*)
FROM src, LATERAL json_array_elements(verbose_log) e
WHERE NOT unreadable AND e->>'func' = 'run_outcome'
GROUP BY 1, 2
UNION ALL
SELECT app_name, '** UNREADABLE (null byte in log) **', count(*)
FROM src WHERE unreadable
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

> **Why the `unreadable` branch exists** (added 2026-08-28). Some machine output
> contains a literal `\u0000`; Postgres refuses to convert that to `text`, so the
> naive form of this query —
> `FROM util.app_run_logs, LATERAL json_array_elements(verbose_log) e` — **aborts
> outright** with `unsupported Unicode escape sequence: \u0000 cannot be converted
> to text`. One bad row in the window kills the entire result. Casting to `jsonb`
> does **not** help (same error). The tempting one-line fix — filtering those rows
> out with `NOT LIKE` — works but makes the health check lie: an app whose log
> happens to contain a null byte silently disappears from the tally, which is
> exactly the "reports clean success while broken" failure this section exists to
> prevent. Hence the `UNION ALL`: unparseable rows are counted and named. A nonzero
> `** UNREADABLE **` line is a real signal — that app's outcomes are NOT covered by
> the tally above it, so check it directly. (On acq-vm-0 this currently surfaces a
> handful of `mmb-rpp` rows per hour.) The upstream fix — stripping null bytes
> before the logger persists — is FOLLOW-UPS 18.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 7: RESOURCE DIRS (bulk create)

```bash
APPS="data_acquisition hhm_rpp_ge hhm_rpp_philips hhm_rpp_siemens \
acumatica_sync monday reports part-source-pipeline incident-engine ops-dashboard \
odd-jobs mmb-rpp alert-processor alert-notify"

sudo mkdir -p /opt/resources/acqu_files
sudo chgrp -R docker /opt/resources/acqu_files
sudo chmod -R 2775   /opt/resources/acqu_files

# sudo throughout: /opt/run-logs is root-owned (STEP 1.2) and its per-app subdirs are
# svc-owned, so an unprivileged chgrp/chmod fails with "Operation not permitted".
for a in $APPS; do sudo mkdir -p "/opt/run-logs/$a"; done
sudo chgrp -R docker /opt/run-logs
sudo chmod -R g+rwXs /opt/run-logs
sudo chown -R svc /opt/run-logs        # container run user writes here as svc:docker
```

The `/opt/run-logs/<app>` dirs are the hot path for release `LOG_DIR` mounts and
for the bounded cron `.out` files — they **must be writable by the container run
user** (svc uid via group docker). The group-write + setgid bits above are what
OPS-05 was about; verify with a real run, not `ls`.
**`/opt/resources/node_mod_cache` is retired fleet-wide** (every app installs
deps in-tree, per copy) — do NOT create it on a new server. On acq-vm-0 the old
per-app cache dirs still exist as orphans awaiting cleanup (follow-up 15).

App status notes:
- **acquisition-v2** — **REMOVED from this server 2026-09-01** (owner decision:
  leftover from a refactor, not coming back here). It was the paused strangler-fig
  replacement for data_acquisition; its totalizer line had been commented out since
  the 2026-07-13 rollback and data_acquisition has owned that job since. Deleted:
  the `/opt/apps/acquisition-v2` checkout, `/opt/run-logs/acquisition-v2`, the
  `node_mod_cache` dir, and the `acquisition-v2:staging` image. The code still
  lives at `git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/data_acquisition-v2.git` — nothing was
  lost, the checkout was clean and in sync with `origin/main`. Do not recreate it
  here without a new decision.
- **odd-jobs** — Jonathan's app, **out of scope, never modify** — but it owns
  partition maintenance (next section), so it must exist and run on any server that
  hosts the database.
- **mmb-rpp, alert-processor, alert-notify** — Jonathan's apps, **out of scope,
  never modify**, and deliberately undocumented here (no clone/build/release/schedule
  instructions: he deploys them, same as odd-jobs). They are nonetheless **live,
  paradigm-migrated job apps on this box** (`USER_ID=svc`, `RELEASE_SHA`-stamped,
  scheduled in the `svc` crontab), and they consume **server-wide resources this
  document owns**: `/opt/run-logs/<app>` (in the `APPS` list above), `pg_net`
  (STEP 2), `redis-admin_redis_net` (STEP 3 — mmb-rpp and alert-processor only), and
  `/opt/resources` mounted read-only. Their compose files use short-form
  `${LOG_DIR:-...}` mounts, so a **missing** `/opt/run-logs/<app>` does not fail
  loudly — Docker auto-creates it root-owned and their logs then silently land
  unwritable-by-`svc`. That is why they belong in the list above even though nothing
  else about them belongs in this document. Coordinate their deployment with
  Jonathan before relying on a rebuilt server.
- **imprivata-poc** — fully self-contained PoC; needs none of these dirs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PARTITION MAINTENANCE — owned by odd-jobs (DB-01)

The 24 binned (partitioned) tables get next month's partitions created and old ones
archived by **Jonathan's odd-jobs app**: job `pg-part-arch`, scheduled in the **`svc`
service account's crontab** (requires root to read: `sudo crontab -l -u svc`), at
**14:00 UTC on the 1st of each month**. This is settled ownership
(keep-and-document, 2026-08): **retiring odd-jobs would silently end partition
maintenance** and produce a fleet-wide outage on the 1st of the following month.

Because that run fails *silently* if it ever breaks, we run an independent, read-only
watchdog: `pg_manage_v2/scripts/check-partition-horizon.sh`, cron `0 9 3,25 * *`
(the 3rd catches a failed run on the 1st with 27 days to react; the 25th catches
anything late-breaking before month-end). It asks one question — "does every binned
table have next month's partition?" — and alerts on any gap. The underlying check:

```sql
-- One row per binned table missing next month's partition (healthy = zero rows)
SELECT parent.relname
FROM pg_partitioned_table pt
JOIN pg_class parent ON parent.oid = pt.partrelid
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM pg_inherits i
  JOIN pg_class child ON child.oid = i.inhrelid
  WHERE i.inhparent = parent.oid
    AND pg_get_expr(child.relpartbound, child.oid)
        LIKE '%' || to_char(date_trunc('month', now() + interval '1 month'), 'YYYY-MM-01') || '%'
);
```

Standing rhythm: in the first week of each month, confirm the new bins appeared
(the watchdog's run on the 3rd does this automatically). A stale copy of the
partition SQL inside data_acquisition misled the August audits — treat odd-jobs as
the single owner; anything else is reference-only.

**Before go-live on a NEW server (audit A21-12):** odd-jobs has no provisioning
path in this document — it is not a git checkout here (Jonathan deploys it: app
tree + vendored node_modules + its images + the `svc` crontab entry). A new
database server **runs without partition maintenance until he does**, and the gap
is silent until the watchdog's first firing (as late as the 3rd of the following
month). Coordinate the odd-jobs deployment with Jonathan before relying on the
server, then verify: `sudo crontab -l -u svc` shows the `pg-part-arch` line, and
the watchdog query returns zero rows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 8: UPDATE ENCRYPTED CREDENTIALS (data_acquisition)

```bash
cd /opt/apps/data_acquisition
./run_scripts/update_db_creds.sh
```

What it actually does (read the script): pins EOL-but-compatible `node:16.20.2`,
then runs `npm ci && npm run update_db_creds` in a container whose `node_modules`
is a **tmpfs** — nothing lands on the host, no cleanup needed afterwards. The
`APP_DIR` path is hardcoded to `/opt/apps/data_acquisition` — edit it if the layout
ever changes.

> ⚠️ **KNOWN DEFECT — running this today breaks the release copy** (found
> 2026-08-28; script fix pending, see FOLLOW-UPS 16). Line 17 is
> `rm -rf "$APP_DIR/node_modules"`, commented "just in case a previous run created

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DATABASE SSL SETUP

## Generate the certificate

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/resources/ssl
sudo install -d -m 700 -o root -g root /opt/resources/ssl/private
openssl genrsa -out /tmp/pg_ssl.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 1095 \
  -key /tmp/pg_ssl.key \
  -out /opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt \
  -subj "/CN=pg_db" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:pg_db,DNS:postgres-server,DNS:localhost,IP:<VM_IP>,IP:127.0.0.1"
sudo mv /tmp/pg_ssl.key /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key
chown $USER:docker /opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt && chmod 644 /opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt
```

CN/SAN must cover every hostname/IP clients use (`pg_db` for dockerized apps on
`pg_net`, localhost/127.0.0.1 for IDE proxies, the VM IP for external clients) or
Node rejects with `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`. Regenerate when the IP changes.

> **Known SAN drift on acq-vm-0 — accepted, fix at next reissue** (verified
> 2026-08-28). The live cert's SAN carries `IP:20.121.125.115` (a public address),
> but this VM's actual address is **`10.2.0.4`**. Nothing is broken by it today:
> all ten apps connect as `PGHOST=pg_db`, which IS in the SAN, and `verify-full`
> over `pg_db` was tested end-to-end and passes. The only thing that would fail is
> a client connecting **by IP** with `verify-full` — an IDE proxy or external tool,
> which nothing currently does. Since regenerating means a Postgres reload plus
> re-distributing the cert to every app, it is deliberately deferred: **add
> `IP:10.2.0.4` when the cert is next reissued** (it expires 2029-05-25). Note
> `20.121.125.115` still routes from this host, so if it is ever reassigned the
> staleness inverts — confirm the SAN against `hostname -I` at reissue time.

## Key permissions (SEC-06 — the layout is the security control)

The key lives in the **root-only directory** `/opt/resources/ssl/private/` (700
root:root), owned by the container postgres uid:

```bash
sudo chown 999:root /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key
sudo chmod 600 /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key
```

Why this exact layout: on acq-vm-0, host uid 999 is `dd-agent` (Datadog), which
collides with the container `postgres` uid. The container reads the key through its
**direct file bind-mount** (mounts bypass host directory traversal), while any host
process running as uid 999 is stopped by the 700 parent directory. The layout is
correct on any server — whatever host account happens to hold uid 999 (Datadog here;
possibly another package's account, or nobody, on a fresh VM) can never traverse to
the key. **Monitoring agents themselves (Datadog) are out of this document's scope**
(audit A21-11): installing one is an org decision made separately — a doc-built
server has no host monitoring until that happens. Verify after setup:

```bash
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -tAc "SHOW ssl;"                 # on
# If a uid-999 host account exists (dd-agent on acq-vm-0):
sudo -u "$(getent passwd 999 | cut -d: -f1)" cat /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key   # Permission denied
```

Cert regeneration: after re-issuing `pg_ssl.crt`, a **`pg_reload_conf()` is
sufficient** (Postgres re-reads SSL files on reload). All clients must re-pull the
new `pg_ssl.crt`.

## App connection contract (what the code actually does)

Apps use libpq-style vars plus two custom ones — **not** `PG_HOST`/`PG_PW`:

```bash
PGHOST=pg_db            # container name on pg_net (VM IP for external clients)
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=<DB_NAME>
PGUSER=<app role>       # see DATABASE ROLES below
PGPASSWORD=<...>
PG_SSLMODE=verify-full  # disable | require | verify-ca | verify-full
PG_SSL_PATH=/opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt
```

`utils/db/pg-pool.js` semantics (per app — see caveat):
- `require` → encrypted but **unverified** (`rejectUnauthorized: false`). Legacy default.
- `verify-ca` / `verify-full` → CA-pinned + verified; Node's TLS also checks the
  hostname against the SAN, so `pg_db` must be in the cert.
- **reports (pilot, target state for all apps): fail-closed** — a verify mode with a
  missing/unreadable CA **throws** instead of silently downgrading. Other apps still
  carry the old helper that downgrades with only a console warning — copying the
  reports fix to each app is part of the role rollout below.

Verification tests:

```bash
psql "host=<VM_IP> dbname=<DB_NAME> user=postgres sslmode=disable"      # expect: rejected
psql "host=<VM_IP> dbname=<DB_NAME> user=postgres sslmode=require"      # expect: connects
psql "host=<VM_IP> dbname=<DB_NAME> user=postgres sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=pg_ssl.crt"  # expect: connects
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DATABASE ROLES — retiring the shared superuser

**Current state:** incident-engine (`incident_engine_rw`), ops-dashboard
(`ops_dashboard_ro`), and reports (`reports_rw`) use dedicated least-privilege roles.
**Every other app still connects as `postgres`** — each is a full-DB blast radius and
must be migrated (Phase 4a).

The pattern (proven three times; scripts to copy):
- `incident-engine/db/setup-owner-role.sql` — owner-role variant (app owns its schema)
- `ops-dashboard/db/setup-readonly-role.sql` — read-only variant
- `reports/db/setup-role.sql` — read-mostly + targeted writes variant, with a
  database-wide fail-closed allowlist audit. Since 2026-08-31 it is also the
  reference for two things the other two scripts lack: a **column-level** grant
  (`SELECT (email_address, status, notify_email, system_list_cache) ON
  public.users` — the feature needs four columns, not the table) and a
  **sequence** grant (`USAGE ON alert.sme_report_sends_id_seq`; the id is
  `BIGSERIAL` and `nextval` in a column DEFAULT executes as the INSERTING role,
  so the INSERT fails without it — a runtime failure, not a deploy-time one)

**Passwords never go on a command line as literals** (SEC-09 — shell history and
`ps` exposure). Generate into a root-only file first, then expand from it. The
`/root/<role>_pw` files are **host state** — keep them; if a host is missing them
(found on acq-vm-0 2026-08-21, and again 2026-08-28 — currently absent), recreate
each from the owning app's `.env` per
**§5.9 Step 0** before re-running any role script:

```bash
sudo install -m 600 -o root -g root /dev/null /root/<role>_pw
sudo sh -c 'head -c 24 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -d "/+=" > /root/<role>_pw'
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v pw="$(sudo cat /root/<role>_pw)" -f - < db/setup-role.sql
```

Per-app migration checklist (repeat for each remaining app):

1. Enumerate the app's schema/table reads and writes (grep `FROM|JOIN|INSERT|UPDATE`
   over its `.js`/`.sql`, plus the logger's `util.app_run_logs` INSERT that every app
   performs; check write targets for serial columns → sequence grants).
2. Write `db/setup-role.sql` in the app repo from the closest template; include the
   fail-closed audit block.
3. Fix the app's vendored `utils/db/pg-pool.js` to the fail-closed version (copy from
   reports) and set `PG_SSLMODE=verify-full` + the `/opt/resources/ssl:ro` mount in
   compose.
4. Apply with the password-file pattern above.
5. Swap `.env` `PGUSER`/`PGPASSWORD`, then smoke test grants (positive reads/writes,
   expected denials, `pg_stat_ssl` check) before the next scheduled run.
6. **Re-run each setup-role script after any app-database reset** (grants die with the
   schema; roles survive) and re-run it BEFORE deploying code needing new grants.

The **paradigm migration** (which this list once tracked) completed fleet-wide
with hhm_rpp_philips on 2026-08-26 — every job app is now on the dev/release
paradigm. The **role rollout itself (Phase 4a) has NOT progressed**: verified
2026-08-27, the seven apps above still carry `PGUSER=postgres`. Suggested role
order (blast radius, low → high): monday → part-source-pipeline →
acumatica_sync → hhm_rpp_siemens → hhm_rpp_ge → hhm_rpp_philips →
data_acquisition (busiest last).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PER-APP ENTRYPOINT & BUILD MATRIX (rows verified 2026-08-28; base reconciliation 2026-08-18)

Standard entrypoint (gosu drop to `RUN_USER`, default `svc`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
RUN_USER="${RUN_USER:-svc}"
export HOME="/home/$RUN_USER"
exec gosu "$RUN_USER" "$@"
```

**Every image is now built by Compose** — `docker compose build` works in every repo
that has an image (the 2.0-era "build RPP by hand" and "do not build acumatica"
instructions are dead):

| App | Entrypoint | Image compose runs | Built by |
|---|---|---|---|
| data_acquisition (**migrated**) | `docker/entrypoint.sh` (baked; root-phase log-dir repair) | `data-acqu:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`) | `bash build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc) |
| hhm_rpp_ge (**migrated 2026-08-26**) | `docker/entrypoint.sh` (baked, gosu drop only — NO log-dir repair; build.sh/preflight create the dev log dir host-side, `/opt/run-logs` pre-created) | `hhm_rpp:${IMAGE_TAG}` (dev = username, release = `svc`; **owns the shared image**) | `bash build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc; the transitional `staging`-alias re-tag step was removed 2026-08-27) |
| hhm_rpp_siemens (**migrated 2026-08-25**) | — (no Dockerfile, on purpose; GE's baked gosu entrypoint, NO log-dir repair — build.sh/preflight create the dev log dir host-side) | `hhm_rpp:${IMAGE_TAG}` = `hhm_rpp:svc` since ge migrated (2026-08-26) | no image build — `build.sh` (deps only) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc) |
| hhm_rpp_philips (**migrated 2026-08-26**) | — (no Dockerfile, on purpose; GE's baked gosu entrypoint, NO log-dir repair — build.sh/preflight create the dev log dir host-side) | `hhm_rpp:${IMAGE_TAG}` = `hhm_rpp:svc` (`IMAGE_TAG=svc` in its release `.env` — the transitional `staging` alias is no longer consumed) | no image build — `build.sh` (deps only) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc) |
| monday (**migrated 2026-08-25**) | `entrypoint.sh` (root, baked; repairs `files/`+`data_outputs/`) | `monday:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`) | `build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release) |
| reports (**migrated 2026-08-26**; PROD app code merged 2026-08-31) | `docker/entrypoint.sh` (baked; root-phase log-dir repair) | `reports:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`; the legacy `aux:` tag is retired — follow-up 10 closed). **NOT a bare node+gosu image since 2026-08-31**: also carries `zip`, `fonts-liberation`, Chromium's shared libs, and a baked Chrome under `/opt/puppeteer` (`PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`) — 2.17 GB | `bash build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc). build.sh derives `CHROME_VERSION` from the installed puppeteer and sets `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true` |
| part-source-pipeline (**migrated**) | `entrypoint.sh` (root, baked; repairs `files/` + the log mount) | `psp:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`) | `build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release) |
| acumatica_sync (**migrated 2026-08-25**) | `entrypoint.sh` (root) | `acu-sync:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`) | `bash build.sh` / release via `build-release.sh` |
| incident-engine (**migrated 2026-08-26**) | `docker/entrypoint.sh` (baked; root-phase log-dir repair, gosu drop) | `incident-engine:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`; replaced stock `node:lts` + `user: "105:987"` pin) | `bash build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc) |
| ops-dashboard (**migrated 2026-08-26**) | `entrypoint.sh` (root, baked; NO dir repair — the app writes no files) | `ops-dashboard:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release = `svc`; replaced stock `node:lts` + `user: "105:987"` pin) | `bash build.sh` (dev) / `build-release.sh` (release, as svc + service restart step 6) |
| imprivata-poc | `docker/entrypoint.sh` (conditional gosu) | `imprivata-poc:local` | `docker compose build app_tools` |
| pg_manage_v2 (**migrated 2026-08-26**, admin-repo subset) | n/a — scheduled jobs are HOST bash scripts (user crontab), no containerized runs | `pg_manage:latest` (dormant seeding tooling only, operator-run; deliberately not identity-tagged) | `docker build -t pg_manage .` (operator, STEP 5) / releases via `build-release.sh` (no image step; provenance = `sha=` in backup.log / partition-watchdog.log) |
| redis-admin (**migrated 2026-08-27**, admin-repo subset) | n/a — four long-running stock `redis:7-alpine` containers, no app code | stock `redis:7-alpine` (no image build; provenance = `com.redis-admin.release_sha` container label) | no build script — releases via `build-release.sh`, then per-instance apply from the release copy (STEP 3; lifecycle commands NEVER from the dev clone) |

Host identity (uid/gid build args, image tags) comes exclusively from each repo's
untracked `.env` — builds fail loudly if unset. That is the convention working, not
an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# SHARED SSH BUNDLE (/opt/resources/ssh)

Used by data_acquisition's SFTP/rsync jobs (mounted
`- /opt/resources/ssh:/opt/resources/ssh:ro`) **and by odd-jobs**, which mounts all of
`/opt/resources:ro` and runs `ssh -F /opt/resources/ssh/config` the same way — a change
to this bundle reaches both apps.

```
/opt/resources/ssh/
├── config         # ssh client config
├── id_dev         # private key (referenced by .env SSH_KEY)
├── known_hosts    # accumulated, verified host keys
└── known_hosts.bak
```

**The working permission model (as verified live) is group-based — do not "tighten" it:**

```
config       664  <owner>:docker
id_dev       640  <owner>:docker    # group-read is REQUIRED: jobs run as svc, which
                                    # reads the key via docker-group membership.
                                    # chmod 600 breaks every SFTP/rsync job unless you
                                    # also chown the key to the container run user.
known_hosts  644  <owner>:docker    # read-only at runtime is fine (the mount is :ro;
                                    # lftp is configured with sftp:auto-confirm)
```

Provisioning a NEW server (the bundle never comes from git):

1. Copy `config`, `id_dev`, `known_hosts` from the existing server over scp (or restore
   from the secret store) into `/opt/resources/ssh/`.
2. `sudo chgrp -R docker /opt/resources/ssh && chmod 664 config && chmod 640 id_dev && chmod 644 known_hosts`
3. Never seed `known_hosts` with blind `ssh-keyscan` against production endpoints —
   carry over the existing verified file.

### Incremental import after a migration (EXISTING server, new inventory)

A systems-inventory seed brings host IPs this server may never have keyed; strict
checking then fails every cycle (the 2026-08-19 migration produced 905
`No ED25519 host key is known` errors in 17 h across 11 systems). Do **not** keyscan
(guardrail 3). Instead push the source server's verified file with
**`scripts/known_hosts_migrate.sh`** (tracked here, **runs on the source server** —
same lifecycle as `redis_migrate.sh`):

```bash
# On the SOURCE (prod) server:
./known_hosts_migrate.sh --dry-run   # validates, ships, reports what would append
./known_hosts_migrate.sh             # backup on target -> append-only merge -> install
```

Semantics: append-only with exact-line dedupe — nothing already on the target is
removed or replaced; the install is atomic (temp + `mv` in the same dir), safe under
live cron. A changed host key ends up with old+new entries (OpenSSH accepts when any
matches); pruning stale keys stays manual. Backup lands at
`/opt/resources/backups/known_hosts.pre-import-<ts>`; the script prints the temp+`mv`
rollback line (a plain `cp` onto the file is blocked by the ACL mask for non-owners).

Verify on the target: `ssh-keygen -F <new-ip> -f /opt/resources/ssh/known_hosts` per
new system, then zero `%host key%` `err_msg` rows in `util.app_run_logs` on the next
`:00/:30` burst. **Single new host:** same procedure works (the merge only appends
what's new), or obtain that host's key from any server that already trusts it — never
keyscan.

# RPP APPS (hhm_rpp_ge / hhm_rpp_philips / hhm_rpp_siemens)

All three run the **same image, `hhm_rpp:${IMAGE_TAG}`**, built from
`hhm_rpp_ge/docker/Dockerfile` (node:lts + gosu entrypoint + the same UID_* build args
as data_acquisition). Philips/Siemens have no Dockerfile on purpose. **The GE repo
owns the image and its compose has the `build:` block** — build there once, before
first run of any RPP app. **All three are migrated** (siemens 2026-08-25, ge +
philips 2026-08-26): dev clones in `~/apps`, `/opt/apps/<app>` is build output,
and each repo's own CLAUDE.md is authoritative for day-to-day operation.

```bash
# Image build happens in ge's DEV CLONE (bash build.sh -> hhm_rpp:<USER_ID>)
# or via ge's build-release.sh (-> hhm_rpp:svc). Never build by hand in
# /opt/apps — that tree is build output.
cd ~/apps/hhm_rpp_ge && bash build.sh
```

All three repos' own CLAUDE.md + build.sh/build-release.sh replace the old
per-app clone/warm-cache instructions that used to live here.

**Philips also owns `log.saved_files` retention** — see SAVED_FILES RETENTION below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ACUMATICA SYNC APP

**MIGRATED to the fleet paradigm 2026-08-25** (fourth, after part-source-pipeline).
Its own CLAUDE.md is authoritative for day-to-day operation; summary:

```bash
# Dev clone (the ONLY editable tree; repo name differs from the app dir):
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/acumatica_table_pull.git ~/apps/acumatica_sync
cd ~/apps/acumatica_sync    # branch STAGING_docker
cp .env.example .env        # fill in; USER_ID=<your username>, #RELEASE:USER_ID=svc
bash build.sh               # in-tree npm install (as you) + image acu-sync:<username>
bash preflight-check.sh     # zero warnings expected (authed sibling-container PG check)

# Release (wipes and replaces /opt/apps/acumatica_sync; clean-tree guarded):
bash build-release.sh       # -> acu-sync:svc, RELEASE_SHA stamped into deployed .env
```

App shape (simplest in the fleet): one job (`node index.js`, no arguments), **no
file writers at all** — console output only, run record one row per run in
`stats.job_runs` (`app_name=acumatica_sync`, `job_name=sync`; monday pattern,
shared table untouched). Boot line `[acumatica_sync] job=sync
release_sha=<sha|dev-tree>` is the console provenance. SIGTERM/SIGINT write an
honest `error` row and exit 1. **No schedule — deliberate** (see
`docs/schedules.md`); a dev run is a real run (same staging table, same prod
Acumatica endpoint), so snapshot `acumatica_systems` before exploratory runs.

The app loads `.env` itself via dotenv (compose deliberately has no `env_file`, so
`$expand`/`$format` in Acumatica URIs survive Compose's `$`-interpolation — REL-02
class; A21-07 interpolation warnings from `docker compose config` remain the
accepted exception). `.env` was cleaned 2026-08-25 (dead keys + commented Azure
passwords removed, owner-approved; pre-cleanup copy in `~/env-backups/`). Known
kept wart: `PG_SSLMODE=require` skips cert verification — the verify-full flip
belongs to the DB-roles rollout, not to casual cleanup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# REPORTS APP

**MIGRATED to the fleet paradigm 2026-08-26** (#7). **The `PROD` branch's
application work was merged into `STAGING_docker` 2026-08-31** (release
`f8ea7e0`): the `sme_reports/` Magnet Health Brief engine, scoped and
customer-scoped summaries, EDU environmental reporting, the `alert.sme_reports`
subscription table, PDF rendering and zip batch delivery. Its own CLAUDE.md is
authoritative for day-to-day operation; summary:

```bash
# Dev clone is the editable tree; /opt/apps/reports is build-release.sh output.
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/reports.git ~/apps/reports
cd ~/apps/reports && git switch STAGING_docker
# .env from .env.example: PGUSER=reports_rw, PG_SSLMODE=verify-full,
# PG_SSL_PATH=/opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt, USER_ID=<you>, host identity args.

# DB, IN THIS ORDER (2026-08-31). setup-role.sql now NAMES alert.sme_report_sends
# and its sequence, and it is non-transactional (DB-03) — against a database
# without those objects it stops midway, having applied everything above the
# failure. The DDL is repeatable, so re-running it on an existing DB is a no-op.
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f - < sql/sme_reports_config.sql
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v pw="$(sudo cat /root/reports_rw_pw)" -f - < db/setup-role.sql

bash build.sh               # in-tree deps + reports:<you>  (MUST precede preflight:
                            #   preflight errors "image reports:<you> missing")
bash preflight-check.sh     # authed verify-full PG as reports_rw + Monday.com me
                            #   query + a REAL headless-Chromium launch (below)
bash build-release.sh       # -> /opt/apps/reports as reports:svc, RELEASE_SHA stamped
```

**This image is no longer "gosu only"** (2026-08-31). `sme_reports` renders every
PDF with headless Chromium and zips batches with the Info-ZIP binary, so the
Dockerfile now also installs `zip`, `fonts-liberation` and Chromium's shared-library
set, and bakes a browser into the image at `/opt/puppeteer` (symlinked
`/usr/local/bin/chrome-headless`, exported as `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`).
Image size went 1.63 GB → 2.17 GB. **New-server prerequisite:** the image build
now needs egress to `storage.googleapis.com` (chrome-for-testing) on top of the
GitHub and npm access STEP 1.4 covers — an air-gapped or egress-filtered host
cannot build reports without mirroring that browser. Three things a rebuild must
not undo:

- **`fonts-liberation` is not cosmetic.** `sme_reports/render/assets/charw8.js` is
  a table of per-character pixel widths measured in Chromium for the
  Helvetica/Arial stack. With no metric-compatible face installed, Chromium
  substitutes and every computed column width is silently wrong — broken PDF
  tables, no error. Verified in the rendered output: the PDF embeds
  `LiberationSans` / `LiberationSans-Bold`.
- **Install the browser with `@puppeteer/browsers`, never `npx puppeteer@<ver>
  browsers install chrome`.** The latter installs the whole puppeteer package
  first and its POSTINSTALL also downloads Chrome — that postinstall hangs
  (observed here: 32 minutes at ~1 KiB/s with 9 s of CPU, while the same
  chrome-for-testing URL served 91 MB/s to the host and 44 MB/s to a plain
  container, and the npm registry was equally fast — it is the installer, not the
  network). `@puppeteer/browsers` fetches the identical build in ~6 s.
- **The Chrome build is derived, not hand-pinned.** `build.sh` reads
  `PUPPETEER_REVISIONS.chrome` out of the puppeteer it just installed and exports
  `CHROME_VERSION` for compose, so bumping the npm dependency moves the baked
  browser with it. `build.sh` also passes `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true` to the
  npm install so ~350 MB of browser never lands in the tree, where
  `build-release.sh` would mirror it into `/opt/apps` on every release.
  puppeteer's `21.x` pin holds on `node:lts` (Node 24 drives Chrome 121) — the
  in-code comment claiming "the server runs Node 16" describes the legacy
  non-docker host, not this one.

Two standing hazards (see its CLAUDE.md): **no schedule is installed, by
decision** — this app had never run on this host, and running a report family
at a `:00`/`:30` minute emails real customers from `alert.reports`
subscriptions; smoke-test at non-matching minutes only. **That decision now
covers the `sme_report` family too**, which emails from `alert.sme_reports`;
those rows are inert until BOTH `enabled=true` AND `dry_run=false`, and the
table is currently empty on this box. The safe smokes are
`node index.js sme_report` at a non-matching minute (outcome `skipped`, exit 0)
and a request file with `"email": false`. The retired
`aux:staging` image and the orphaned `/opt/resources/node_mod_cache/reports`
dir await post-cutover cleanup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# MONDAY APP

**MIGRATED to the fleet paradigm 2026-08-25** (second after the pilot). Its own
CLAUDE.md is authoritative for day-to-day operation — **but read its banner first**:
as of 2026-08-28 `~/apps/monday/CLAUDE.md` still opens with a ⚠️ MID-MIGRATION
notice warning that its sections may describe either pre- or post-migration state.
The migration itself is complete (verified: `monday:svc`, `RELEASE_SHA` stamped,
release copy is build output); the banner is an un-closed tail, tracked alongside the
other banner-off items in FOLLOW-UPS 15. Where that file and this one disagree on
day-to-day operation, prefer it — but treat anything it frames as "pre-migration" as
stale. Summary:

```bash
# Dev clone (the ONLY editable tree):
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/monday.git ~/apps/monday
cd ~/apps/monday && git switch STAGING_docker
# ^ REQUIRED: this repo's origin/HEAD is PROD — a plain clone lands on PROD, not
#   STAGING_docker, and nothing downstream would tell you. Verify before building:
#   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD   # expect STAGING_docker
cp .env.example .env    # fill in; USER_ID=<your username>, #RELEASE:USER_ID=svc
bash build.sh           # in-tree npm install (as you) + image monday:<username>
bash preflight-check.sh # zero warnings expected (authed PG + Monday.com checks)

# Release (wipes and replaces /opt/apps/monday; clean-tree guarded):
bash build-release.sh   # -> monday:svc, RELEASE_SHA stamped into deployed .env
```

App shape (differs from the pilot): **no file logger** — the run record is one
row per run in `stats.job_runs` (shared with data_acquisition), plus the boot
console line `[monday] job=<name> release_sha=<sha|dev-tree>` captured by the
cron `.out` files in `/opt/run-logs/monday/`. Provenance is the stamped `.env`
+ boot line, NOT a DB column (2026-08-25 decision: shared table left alone).
SIGTERM/SIGINT write an honest `error` row and exit 1.

**Schedule: deliberately STOPPED — do NOT restore it on a rebuild** (owner decision;
state confirmed 2026-08-28). monday writes to the **live Monday.com API**, not just to
this database, so a running schedule on staging mutates real production boards. It is
stopped for exactly that reason — the same class of decision as reports (emails real
customers) and part-source-pipeline (vendor SFTP), both also dormant by choice.

Last run was **2026-08-25 14:10 UTC**; `stats.job_runs` has had no monday row since,
and the cron `.out` files in `/opt/run-logs/monday/` are frozen at that date. **That is
the intended state, not a fault** — do not "fix" it by reinstalling the entries.

Historical cadences, recorded only so nobody reconstructs them by guesswork if the app
is ever deliberately revived: 5 entries in the shared svc crontab —
`process_new_additions` every 10 min, `update_mmb_he_data` :20/:50, `update_hhm_status`
hourly :50, dailies 04:20/07:25 UTC. `new_avconn_tickets` is dead (2026-04-21) — never
schedule it. Reviving any of these is an owner decision about live external data, not a
routine deployment step.

`.env` points at the real **`staging`** database (the pre-August `dev` value was a
standing failure — REL-02). The app reads `PGUSER` (`utils/db/pg-pool.js`); compose
forces `PG_SSLMODE=require` for now (switch to verify-full during its role migration).
Known kept warts (per monday/CLAUDE.md): an active Azure-PROD `PG_*` fallback block
in `.env` and an unused `db/pgPool.js` hardwired to prod — do not "clean" without
Matt's sign-off, and never remove the `PGHOST` lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PART SOURCE PIPELINE APP

**MIGRATED to the fleet paradigm 2026-08-25** (third, after monday). Its own
CLAUDE.md is authoritative for day-to-day operation; summary:

```bash
# Dev clone (the ONLY editable tree):
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/part-source-pipeline.git ~/apps/part-source-pipeline
cd ~/apps/part-source-pipeline && git switch STAGING_docker
# ^ REQUIRED: this repo's origin/HEAD is PROD — a plain clone lands on PROD, not
#   STAGING_docker, and nothing downstream would tell you. Verify before building:
#   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD   # expect STAGING_docker
cp .env.example .env             # fill in; USER_ID=<your username>, #RELEASE:USER_ID=svc
bash build.sh                    # in-tree npm install (as you) + image psp:<username>
bash preflight-check.sh          # zero warnings expected (authed PG + HCA OData checks)

# Release (wipes and replaces /opt/apps/part-source-pipeline; clean-tree guarded):
bash build-release.sh            # -> psp:svc, RELEASE_SHA stamped into deployed .env
```

App shape: vendored variant-B file logger + `util.app_run_logs` self-log
(paradigm form: fixed container log path, `${LOG_DIR:-./utils/logger/logs}`
mount, `#RELEASE:LOG_DIR=/opt/run-logs/part-source-pipeline`; the hyphen-host /
underscore-container mapping is intentional — the container path must match
`APP_NAME=part_source_pipeline`). Jobs: `hca_sync` (Acumatica OData →
`api.hca_odata`), `inv_feed_sync` (feeds → `files/*.csv` → vendor SFTP;
`SKIP_SFTP=1` skips the upload), `send_csv_sftp` (dead test scaffolding).

**Schedule: deliberately DORMANT** (owner decision 2026-08-25) — the app is
released and verified but has NO cron entries anywhere; its pre-migration
hourly `hca_sync` was stopped 2026-08-19 and stays stopped. Known kept warts
(per psp/CLAUDE.md): SFTP credential in git history (accepted exception
2026-08-18), vendor SFTP currently keyless (uploads cannot work), commented
Azure PROD block in `.env` (compose pins `PGHOST=pg_db`), `PGUSER=postgres`
pending the role migration (Phase 4a).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# INCIDENT-ENGINE APP

**Migrated to the paradigm 2026-08-26** (fleet rollout #8 — see BACKLOG 6n). Cron-batch
error→incident pipeline with its own image `incident-engine:${USER_ID}` (gosu
entrypoint; the pre-paradigm stock `node:lts` + `user: "105:987"` pin and the
`/opt/apps/incident-engine-deploy` git worktree are retired). Owns schema `incidents`;
reads `util.app_run_logs` + `stats.acquisition_history`; self-logs through a
DB-enforced check-option view, boot note carries `RELEASE_SHA`. Deploy **before
ops-dashboard** (its role script grants SELECT on `incidents.*`).

```bash
# Dev clone (the editable tree; /opt/apps/incident-engine is release output ONLY)
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/incident-engine.git ~/apps/incident-engine
cd ~/apps/incident-engine             # tracks main
sudo mkdir -p /opt/run-logs/incident-engine
sudo chown svc:docker /opt/run-logs/incident-engine && sudo chmod 2775 /opt/run-logs/incident-engine
cp .env.example .env
# PGUSER=incident_engine_rw, PG_SSLMODE=verify-full, PG_SSL_PATH=/opt/resources/ssl/pg_ssl.crt,
# USER_ID=<your username>, DOCKER_GID/UID_0/UID_1/UID_2 from THIS host (see .env.example)

# Provision DB (superuser, IN THIS ORDER; re-run both after any app-database reset;
# password-file pattern per DATABASE ROLES):
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -f - < db/schema.sql
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v pw="$(sudo cat /root/incident_engine_rw_pw)" -f - < db/setup-owner-role.sql

bash build.sh                          # in-tree deps + image incident-engine:<you>
bash preflight-check.sh                # expect zero warnings

# ⚠️ These are NOT read-only smoke tests. The dev clone's .env points at the SAME
# live database as the release (PGDATABASE=<DB_NAME>, PGHOST=pg_db) — there is no
# separate dev DB on this stack. `materialize` writes incidents.error_events and
# `assess` writes severity/confidence/state to real incidents. Only `noop` is inert.
# On an EXISTING server this mutates production incident data; the writes are
# idempotent (the second `assess` proves it) but they are still writes. On a NEW
# server build that is exactly what you want. Run the two write jobs only when you
# intend to, and see incident-engine's CLAUDE.md before doing so on a live box.
RUN_USER=$(id -un) docker compose run --rm app node index.js noop        # lifecycle smoke (inert)
RUN_USER=$(id -un) docker compose run --rm app node index.js materialize # WRITES incidents.*
RUN_USER=$(id -un) docker compose run --rm app node index.js assess      # WRITES incidents.*
RUN_USER=$(id -un) docker compose run --rm app node index.js assess      # second pass proves idempotency

# Release (wipes/mirrors /opt/apps/incident-engine, stamps RELEASE_SHA, builds :svc)
bash build-release.sh
(cd /opt/apps/incident-engine && bash preflight-check.sh && docker compose run --rm app node index.js noop)
```

Cron (see `docs/schedules.md`) — hardened entry in the operating user's crontab,
release copy, svc via the entrypoint default:

```cron
25,55 * * * * cd /opt/apps/incident-engine && /usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/incident-engine.run.lock /usr/bin/docker compose run --rm -T app node index.js run >/opt/run-logs/incident-engine/cron.run.out 2>&1
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OPS-DASHBOARD APP

**Migrated 2026-08-26.** **Long-running HTTP service** (the only one):
`docker compose up -d`, not `run --rm`. Read-only Express dashboard over
`util.app_run_logs`, `restart: unless-stopped`, log cap in compose. On the
paradigm: own image `ops-dashboard:${USER_ID}` (dev = username, release =
`svc` via gosu entrypoint — the stock `node:lts` + `user: "105:987"` pin is
retired), in-tree `node_modules` (the `node_mod_cache` and `/opt/run-logs`
mounts are retired — the app writes NO files; its run record is the self-log
heartbeat in `util.app_run_logs`, which carries `RELEASE_SHA`/`USER_ID` in
its boot note, plus a boot console line). Service-specific split: dev clone
runs compose project `ops-dashboard-dev` on `:8081`, the release runs
`ops-dashboard` on `:8080` — `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`/`HOST_PORT` fail safe to
the dev values so a dev `up -d` can never recreate the production container.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/ops-dashboard.git ~/apps/ops-dashboard
cd ~/apps/ops-dashboard              # tracks main; /opt/apps copy is build output
cp .env.example .env                 # identity keys + PG creds (role password files below)

# Roles (superuser, once; incident-engine must already be deployed or the fail-closed
# script errors on the missing incidents.* grant targets; password-file pattern):
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v ro_pw="$(sudo cat /root/ops_dashboard_ro_pw)" < db/setup-readonly-role.sql
# Only if SELF_LOG_ENABLED=true:
docker exec -i pg_db psql -U postgres -d <DB_NAME> -v rw_pw="$(sudo cat /root/ops_dashboard_rw_pw)" < db/setup-writer-role.sql

bash build.sh && bash preflight-check.sh    # expect ZERO warnings
bash build-release.sh                        # release + RESTARTS the service (step 6)
curl -s localhost:8080/healthz              # {"ok":true}
curl -s localhost:8080/api/jobs/latest      # 503 "warming" briefly, then 200
```

`build-release.sh` carries a service-specific step 6 (`docker compose up -d`
from the release copy as svc) — a service release is not live until the
container is recreated; batch apps have no such step. Re-run
`setup-readonly-role.sql` after DB resets or before deploying endpoints needing
new grants (else 500 permission-denied) — then re-release rather than
restarting by hand. Port 8080 is published on all interfaces — the NSG is the
boundary; the auth-proxy hardening remains a follow-up (the pinned-image half
is done by the migration).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IMPRIVATA POC APP

Python PoC (paramiko + Imprivata PAS/CPAM SDK), fully self-contained: no `/opt`
resources, no `pg_net`, no DB. Tracks `main`. Read `docs/README-HANDOFF.md` +
`docs/runbook.md` first.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Matt-Teixeira/imprivata-poc.git /opt/apps/imprivata-poc
cd /opt/apps/imprivata-poc
# 1) Vendor SDK wheel into sdk/ (gitignored; NEVER commit).
# 2) secrets/securelink.properties (gitignored; keep WRITABLE — the SDK rotates `secret`).
mkdir -p secrets output
cp .env.example .env
# .env MUST override SDK_WHEEL to the 3.2.0 wheel — the compose default still points
# at a stale 2.11.0 filename and the build fails without the override. Also set
# IMPRIVATA_CUSTOMER_NAME / IMPRIVATA_SITE_NAME / IMPRIVATA_REMOTE_PATH.
python3 preflight.py
docker compose build app_tools
docker compose run --rm app_tools bash -lc "python /workspace/check_prereqs.py"
docker compose run --rm app_tools bash -lc "python /workspace/poc_pull_file.py"
```

Entrypoint is a conditional gosu drop; with `RUN_USER` unset it runs as root with
`HOME=/workspace/scm-home` (bind-mounted SDK log persistence). Acceptable for a PoC;
resolve before any production use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 9: SCHEDULES

The complete, live crontab (owner: `matt-teixeira`) with the stagger design, the
incident-engine deploy-worktree requirement, and install/rollback commands
lives in **`docs/schedules.md`** — treat that file as the
manifest: **a schedule that is not in it does not exist**, and it must be kept in
sync with `crontab -l`.

> **2026-08-24:** data_acquisition's 24 entries were replaced with hardened ones
> (direct `node index.js` argv, `flock -n`, `-T`, absolute paths, bounded
> `cron.<job>.out` files) at the paradigm cutover — the installed set is
> `data_acquisition/cron-bk/crontab.restore-2026-08-24.cron`.
> **2026-08-26:** hhm_rpp_ge's and hhm_rpp_philips' user-crontab entries were
> hardened the same way at their cutovers (cadences unchanged).
> **2026-08-27:** `schedules.md` was synced to match — it now carries the hardened
> GE (3) and Philips (18) entries verbatim and its header count agrees with the
> live crontab (50 active entries, verified 2026-08-28).

The maintenance schedule at a glance:

| When | What |
|---|---|
| 02:15 nightly | `pg_manage_v2/scripts/backup.sh` |
| 03:30 nightly | `data_acquisition/scripts/prune-run-logs.sh` |
| 09:00 on the 3rd & 25th | `pg_manage_v2/scripts/check-partition-horizon.sh` |
| :05/:35 | `hhm_rpp_philips` `delete_old_db_files` (saved_files 48 h retention) |
| 14:00 UTC, 1st (svc crontab — odd-jobs) | partition create/archive (`pg-part-arch`) |

Always snapshot before editing:

```bash
crontab -l > /opt/resources/backups/crontab-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).txt
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 10: BACKUPS & MAINTENANCE (installed, not proposed)

All scripts are **tracked in their owning repos** and already scheduled (STEP 9).

- **`pg_manage_v2/scripts/backup.sh`** — nightly 02:15: `pg_dump -Fc <DB_NAME>` (via its `PG_DB` variable, default `staging`)
  (structurally verified with `pg_restore --list` before reporting success) + a
  reply-checked `SAVE` and RDB copy of all four Redis instances (`redis-cli` exits 0
  even when refused — the script checks for a literal `OK`; all four instances
  authenticate via their mounted auth.conf). Local retention: 7 days pg /
  14 days Redis under `/opt/resources/backups/`. Logs one line per night to
  `backup.log` — "newest backup < 25 h old" is a standing health check. Since the
  2026-08-26 migration every line ends `sha=<RELEASE_SHA|dev-tree>` (release
  provenance), every exit path logs exactly one line (EXIT-trap catch-all), an
  unverified/partial dump is removed rather than left looking like a backup, and
  the cron entry captures to `/opt/run-logs/pg_manage_v2/cron.backup.out` instead
  of `/dev/null`. `pg_manage_v2/preflight-check.sh` checks the whole chain
  (including backup.log freshness) with zero-warning standard.
  **Local-only until decision D4 picks an off-host target** (Azure storage is the
  natural fit) — then enable the sync stub at the bottom of the script (Phase 4g).
- **`data_acquisition/scripts/prune-run-logs.sh`** — nightly 03:30, the
  cross-app **log lifecycle** (bundling added 2026-08-27, FLEET-TODO 2b):
  per-run logs older than 2 days are tar'd per day into
  `/opt/run-logs/<app>/archive/YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz` (~15× compression,
  180-day bundle retention); loose-file prunes remain as the safety net
  (30 d central / 14 d dev trees). Only `*-log.*` per-run files are ever
  bundled — `cron.*.out` and append-mode `*.log` files never match.
  Summary to `/opt/run-logs/data_acquisition/prune.log` (nothing loose
  lives at the run-logs root; `partition-watchdog.log` moved to
  `pg_manage_v2/` the same day).
- **Container log rotation** — per-service `logging:` blocks in the tracked compose
  files (see CONVENTIONS). There is deliberately no `daemon.json` step.
- **Reference dumps** kept outside retention on purpose: `staging-20260727-1933.dump.initial`,
  `staging-20260817-1324.dump.full` (the last full dumps that include
  `log.saved_files` history).

Restore test (once per server, after any pg major upgrade, and as part of acceptance):

```bash
docker exec pg_db createdb -U postgres restore_test
docker exec -i pg_db pg_restore -U postgres -d restore_test --no-owner < /opt/resources/backups/pg/<DB_NAME>-<date>.dump
docker exec pg_db psql -U postgres -d restore_test -c "SELECT count(*) FROM alert.models;"
docker exec pg_db dropdb -U postgres restore_test
```

## SAVED_FILES RETENTION (DB-05 — restored 2026-08-18)

`log.saved_files` holds raw Philips machine-file blobs (~381 kB each, incompressible,
~7,600 rows/day). Retention policy: **48 hours** (decision D2), enforced by
`hhm_rpp_philips`'s `delete_old_db_files` job every 30 minutes at `:05/:35` —
batched deletes on the indexed column, session advisory lock
(`hashtext('log.saved_files:retention')`), per-batch timeouts, `run_outcome/v1`
participation (lock-busy = `skipped`, exit 0). History: the original cron line was
lost in the hhm_rpp three-way split and the table silently grew to 141 GB / 40 days
before being purged back to ~6 GB.

Steady state to expect: **~15,000 rows** (48 h of retention) occupying **~12 GB**
on disk, with the nightly dump around **17–18 GB** (measured 2026-08-28; the earlier
"~6 GB / ~10 GB" figures were the immediate post-purge low and have been corrected).
**Judge health by ROW COUNT, not size** — the two diverge: rows track retention
directly, while on-disk size also carries table bloat that only `VACUUM FULL`
reclaims. A row count near ~15,000 with a larger-than-expected size means bloat, not
a retention failure. If the ROW COUNT is far above that, the retention job has been
failing — check its outcomes in `util.app_run_logs` (a persistent `skipped` streak
means something holds the advisory lock). A large backlog must be cleared with **batched deletes + a
post-purge `VACUUM FULL` in a quiet minute** — never one big `DELETE`, and remember
plain `VACUUM` does not return the disk space.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# SECURITY BASELINE (what a built server must satisfy)

- **No secrets in any repo's current tree** — rotated and scrubbed 2026-08-17
  (SEC-01/02); a worktree scan for credentials must come back empty. **One accepted
  exception in history** (owner decision 2026-08-18): part-source-pipeline's git
  history retains an SFTP credential the vendor cannot rotate — a history-aware
  scan WILL find it; repo access control is the boundary for it. Secret scanner in
  CI is tracked debt (Phase 4e).
- **Secrets on disk** follow the root-only-file pattern (CONVENTIONS): the pg
  superuser password file, the pg TLS key, the Redis auth file.
- **Build hygiene**: allowlist `.dockerignore` in every repo that builds an image
  (SEC-10) — context must be KBs, never contain `.env`/`.git`/logs.
- **Network**: the server has no public IP; the Azure NSG is the boundary — verify
  its rules for 5432 and 8080 (Redis has no host ports at all). Binding pg/dashboard
  to specific interfaces (SEC-11) is deliberately deferred.
- **Redis**: auth on **all four instances** (redis-STAGING standardized 2026-08-19;
  odd-jobs' client-side auth must be coordinated with Jonathan).
- **Postgres**: hostssl-only; container metadata carries no password; per-app roles
  are the target state (3 of 10 done).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FOLLOW-UPS (known debt, deliberately deferred — Phase 4 of the plan)

1. **DB roles fleet rollout** (4a) — 7 apps still connect as `postgres` with
   unverified TLS; per-app checklist above.
2. **Verified TLS everywhere** (4b) — copy reports' fail-closed pg-pool to each app.
2b. **Archived-partition grant drift** (new 2026-08-31) — reports hit it and now
    sweeps for it. **Checked 2026-08-31: `incident_engine_rw`, `ops_dashboard_ro`
    and `ops_dashboard_rw` are all clean, and structurally not exposed** — they
    grant table-by-table, never `ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` over a partitioned
    schema, so their grants live on parent tables that are never moved. No action
    needed on them today. The debt is that reports' script is the **template this
    document tells you to copy**, and the exposure travels with the pattern: any
    new role granting schema-wide over `alert`/`edu`/`mag`/`log`/`util` inherits
    it. Port the ARCHIVED-PARTITION SWEEP whenever you copy that template.
3. **Stricter secret/config file permissions + runtime group** (4d).
4. **Version pinning + CI checks** (4e) — `node:lts` is mutable; pin per-app; add
   secret-scanning and compose-validation to CI.
5. **DB tuning & the June OOM** (4f) — `pg_stat_statements` is now collecting; add
   memory guardrails to pg_db compose from measured peaks.
6. **Off-host encrypted backups** (4g) — blocked on decision D4.
7. **Cron mail cleanup** (4h) — 400 MB spool, some sensitive output.
8. **External-endpoint inventory** (4i) — which staging jobs touch real prod systems
   (Acumatica, Monday, SFTP), with per-env credentials/mode.
9. **odd-jobs Redis auth support** — redis-STAGING is auth'd like the rest since
   2026-08-19 (reverses the 2026-08-18 passwordless decision). odd-jobs' client
   must authenticate to reach it; until Jonathan confirms/ships that, odd-jobs'
   Redis access fails fast with NOAUTH — coordinate before the next `pg-part-arch`
   run (1st of the month) if that job touches Redis.
10. ~~**reports image tag**~~ — DONE 2026-08-26 with reports' migration: the image
    is `reports:${USER_ID}`; verified nothing consumed `aux:` (no compose file,
    container, or script). The orphaned `aux:staging` image itself is
    post-cutover cleanup.
11. ~~**incident-engine / ops-dashboard hardcoded ids**~~ — DONE 2026-08-26 by
    their migrations: the compose `user: "105:987"` pins are retired (gosu
    entrypoint + `.env` build args). (reports' literals were already
    parameterized pre-migration, REL-07.)
12. **systems-inventory sync policy (B0a)** — named decision + owner (see 5.5).
13. **git-history scrub of the old DB password** (D3) — value is dead; cleanup only.
14. **PROD** (4j) — branches, cutover runbook, data governance: unblocked once this
    document passes acceptance.
15. **Post-migration orphan cleanup** — ~~the `hhm_rpp:staging` alias~~ (DONE
    2026-08-27: re-tag step removed from ge's `build-release.sh` — commit
    `fabd749` — and the tag deleted; `hhm_rpp:pre-ge-migration` kept as the
    rollback handle). Still open: the orphaned `/opt/resources/node_mod_cache/*`
    per-app dirs (no compose file references the cache anymore); the `aux:staging`
    image (from #10). Also close out the migration tails — ~~hhm_rpp_philips~~
    (6q COMPLETE 2026-08-27: verified, banner off, release `3a2c0ec`),
    pg_manage_v2's verification (BACKLOG 6p), redis-admin's banner-off
    (BACKLOG 6r; verification tail = two clean cron cycles of the consuming
    apps + the next nightly backup line), and **monday's banner-off** (found
    2026-08-28: `~/apps/monday/CLAUDE.md` still opens with a MID-MIGRATION
    notice though the migration completed 2026-08-25 — see MONDAY APP). The
    working queue for all of this now lives in `docs/FLEET-TODO.md`.
16. **`update_db_creds.sh` deletes the release's `node_modules`** (found
    2026-08-28, STEP 8) — line 17's `rm -rf "$APP_DIR/node_modules"` predates the
    paradigm and was correct when deps lived in the shared `node_mod_cache`; with
    in-tree per-copy deps it destroys the live release's dependency tree (~49 MB)
    and breaks every data_acquisition cron job until the next `build-release.sh`.
    The container mounts a tmpfs over that path, so the deletion serves no purpose
    for the run. Fix in the data_acquisition repo (drop the line, or scope it to a
    genuine stray-detection check); the doc carries a warning until then.
17. **`activate_redis_auth.sh` dev-clone paths are operator-specific** (found
    2026-08-28, STEP 3 step 4) — four of the ten `ENVS` entries are hardcoded to
    `/home/matt-teixeira/apps/...`. Correct under `sudo` on acq-vm-0, silently
    skipped on any server with a different operator. Make the dev-clone owner a
    variable (or derive it from `SUDO_USER`) in the redis-admin repo; the doc
    carries a coverage check until then.
18. **Null bytes reach `util.app_run_logs`** (found 2026-08-28) — some machine
    output contains a literal `\u0000`, which Postgres cannot convert to `text`.
    Any query doing `json_array_elements(verbose_log)` over a window containing
    one **aborts entirely** (`unsupported Unicode escape sequence`); `::jsonb`
    behaves the same. The fleet health read (THE OUTCOME CONTRACT) now isolates and
    counts these rows rather than dying or hiding them, but the tally cannot cover
    them. Upstream fix: strip/replace null bytes in the logger before persisting
    (`utils/logger`, vendored per app — so it is a fleet-wide change). Currently
    visible on `mmb-rpp`. Until then, a nonzero `** UNREADABLE **` line means those
    outcomes need checking by hand.
19. **`redis_migrate.sh` does not emit a source key count** (found 2026-08-28,
    STEP 4) — the seed verification is stated three times as "must equal the source
    count", but nothing produces that number, so the check historically compared
    against a remembered guess and a half-loaded Redis would pass. STEP 4 now takes
    `SOURCE_KEYS` as an explicit variable and asserts against it, but the operator
    must capture it by hand on the source. Fix in the data_acquisition repo: have
    `redis_migrate.sh` record `DBSIZE` per instance alongside the RDB it ships
    (e.g. a `.keycount` sidecar), so the target can assert without a manual step.

# ACCEPTANCE TEST (item 13 — run by someone who didn't write this doc)

Build a blank dev/staging VM from this document alone, then demonstrate **all** of:

**Provenance & config**
- [ ] Every referenced repo/branch/file/image exists; every `docker compose config`
      validates with **zero warnings — except acumatica_sync's documented
      `$expand`/`$format` interpolation warnings** (inherent to its no-`env_file`
      dotenv design, A21-07; count varies with its `$`-bearing URIs); a
      **worktree** secret scan finds nothing (the psp *history* credential is an
      accepted exception — see SECURITY BASELINE).
- [ ] Config values arrive byte-for-byte inside containers (spot-check an Acumatica
      URI with `$` characters from inside its container).
- [ ] Committed `.env.example` files contain placeholders only — no real uid/gid/tag
      values (REL-07).

**Identity & permissions**
- [ ] Each container runs as its intended uid:gid and can write its mounts (run a
      real job per app — a directory existing is not the test).
- [ ] `/opt/run-logs/<app>/` receives fresh files from a scheduled run of each
      family via the release `LOG_DIR` mount — files named
      `<app>-log.svc.<run_id>.json` and rows in `util.app_run_logs` carrying the
      release's `RELEASE_SHA`. (Apps without a file logger — monday,
      acumatica_sync, ops-dashboard, pg_manage_v2 — verify instead from their
      run record: `stats.job_runs` rows, the self-log heartbeat, or
      `sha=`-stamped backup/watchdog log lines, plus bounded cron `.out` files.)

**Database**
- [ ] Non-SSL connection rejected; `verify-full` passes; `docker inspect pg_db` shows
      zero `POSTGRES_PASSWORD*`; healthcheck healthy; `pg_stat_statements` returns rows.
- [ ] If any host account holds uid 999 (dd-agent on acq-vm-0; check
      `getent passwd 999`): `sudo -u <that account> cat
      /opt/resources/ssl/private/pg_ssl.key` → Permission denied. (No uid-999
      account = nothing to test; note that the server has no monitoring agent —
      out of doc scope, A21-11.)
- [ ] Every binned table has ≥1 month of future partitions (watchdog query returns
      zero rows) and the watchdog cron is installed.
- [ ] **odd-jobs is deployed and scheduled** (Jonathan): `sudo crontab -l -u svc`
      shows the `pg-part-arch` line — a new DB server without it has no partition
      maintenance (A21-12). The same listing is the check for Jonathan's other
      scheduled apps (mmb-rpp, alert-processor) and for hhm_rpp_siemens.
- [ ] **Role password files exist**: `sudo ls -l /root/*_pw` lists one per
      provisioned role, each non-empty. They are host state, not in git, and have
      gone missing twice (2026-08-21, 2026-08-28) — absent files break every
      `setup-role.sql` re-run at §5.9 Step 0, silently until a reseed needs them.
- [ ] The systems inventory has been reconciled against prod (B0a) and the delta
      recorded.

**Redis**
- [ ] No Redis ports on the host; anonymous `PING` → NOAUTH on **all four**
      instances; authenticated `PING` → PONG; `appendonly=yes` from the mounted
      configs; key counts match the seed source.

**Jobs & honesty**
- [ ] One scheduled job from each family completes; outcomes land in
      `util.app_run_logs` with `run_outcome` events.
- [ ] A deliberately-broken test job exits nonzero and records `failed` — the
      fail-loudly contract holds on the rebuilt server.
- [ ] `log.saved_files` holds ≤ ~3 days of rows and the `:05/:35` retention job shows
      `success` outcomes.

**Safety net**
- [ ] `backup.sh` produces a dump that passes the restore test; newest backup < 25 h;
      Redis SAVE verified against auth'd instances; prune log shows a run.
- [ ] Long-running containers show `max-size` in `docker inspect` LogConfig.
- [ ] A full host reboot brings back pg_db, all four Redis (still auth'd — requirepass
      survives restart via the mounted include), ops-dashboard, and the schedules
      without manual help.

When this list passes on staging **and** on a rebuild, "build from the doc" and
"clone staging" mean the same thing — the golden image exists.
