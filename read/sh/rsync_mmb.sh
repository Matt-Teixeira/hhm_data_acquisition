# sudo chown -R remoteservices:ansible_users /opt/files/SMEXXXXX

# The following command "sudo chown -R remoteservices:ansible_users /opt/files/SME" will change the ownership of the "/opt/files/SME" 
# directory and all its contents to the "remoteservices" user and the "ansible_users" group, recursively.

# Here's a breakdown of the command:

# "sudo": runs the command with administrative privileges.
# "chown": changes the owner and group of the specified files or directories.
# "-R": applies the changes recursively to all files and subdirectories in the specified directory.
# "remoteservices": specifies the new owner of the directory.
# "ansible_users": specifies the new group of the directory.
# "/opt/files/SME": specifies the directory that is being modified.
# Therefore, after running this command, the "remoteservices" user will become the owner of the "/opt/files/SME" directory and all its contents, 
# and the "ansible_users" group will be the group owner.

# sudo chmod +664 -R /opt/files/SMEXXXXX

# The following command "sudo chmod +664 -R" will give read and write permission to the owner and group, 
# and read permission to others for all files and subdirectories in the specified directory, recursively.

# Here's a breakdown of the command:

# "sudo": runs the command with administrative privileges.
# "chmod": changes the file mode bits of the specified files or directories.
# "+664": adds read and write permission to the owner and group, and read permission to others.
# "-R": applies the permission changes recursively to all files and subdirectories in the specified directory.
# Therefore, after running this command, all files and directories in the specified directory will have the following permission:

# The owner will have read and write permission.
# The group will have read and write permission.
# Others will have read permission.
